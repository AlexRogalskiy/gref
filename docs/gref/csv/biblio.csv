30951931,The top 100 cited articles on Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD): A citation analysis.,"Parmar, Arpit A|Ganesh, Ragul R|Mishra, Ashwani Kumar AK",Asian journal of psychiatry,2019 Apr,"There is an exponential growth in the field of biomedical literature over the years. Although numerous articles are published every year, few of them present important conceptual advances in that particular field and are found to be influential in the evolution of the field. The number of citations a publication receives can be used as a proxy marker of its impact on the field. Hence we aimed to analyze the top cited articles (n = 100) on obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) as of July 2018. Google scholar database was searched using a freely available software, Publish or Perish. Information related to number of citations, publication title, publication year, name of the journal, country of origin, author details, institution of origin, article type, and article design. The original research articles were further classified into descriptive/epidemiology, mechanism, management, scale/measurement, imaging and medical psychiatry. The citation classics suggest that clinical trials/management, epidemiology and neuroimaging were the most researched areas in the OCD research. These citation classics provide an important insight into the historical developments, like the role of serotonin and caudate in OCD. This approach of citation analysis provides an opportunity to retrieve the classic articles on OCD, and describes the trends in OCD research.",,34501790|31413901,21652082|23971438|22898633|29294394|27127230

PubMed focuses mainly on life sciences and biomedical disciplines, whereas Scopus and Web of Science are multidisciplinary. The protocol described in the current study was used to search for publications from Jordanian authors in the years 2013-2017. In this protocol, how to use each database to conduct this type of search is explained in detail. A Scopus search resulted in the highest number of documents (11,444 documents), followed by a Web of Science search (10,943 documents). PubMed resulted in a smaller number of documents due to its narrower scope and coverage (4,363 documents). The results also show a yearly trend in: (1) the number of publications, (2) the disciplines that have the most publications, (3) the countries of collaboration, and (4) the number of open access publications. In contrast, PubMed has a sophisticated keyword optimization service (i.e., Medical Subject Heading, or MeSH), while both Scopus and Web of Science provide search analysis tools that can produce representative figures.

25940769,A descriptive and historical review of bibliometrics with applications to medical sciences.,"Thompson, Dennis F DF|Walker, Cheri K CK",Pharmacotherapy,2015 Jun,"The discipline of bibliometrics involves the application of mathematical and statistical methods to scholarly publications. The first attempts at systematic data collection were provided by Alfred Lotka and Samuel Bradford, who subsequently established the foundational laws of bibliometrics. Eugene Garfield ushered in the modern era of bibliometrics with the routine use of citation analysis and systematized processing. Key elements of bibliometric analysis include database coverage, consistency and accuracy of the data, data fields, search options, and analysis and use of metrics. A number of bibliometric applications are currently being used in medical science and health care. Bibliometric parameters and indexes may be increasingly used by grant funding sources as measures of research success. Universities may build benchmarking standards from bibliometric data to determine academic achievement through promotion and tenure guidelines in the future. This article reviews the history, definition, laws, and elements of bibliometric principles and provides examples of bibliometric applications to the broader health care community. To accomplish this, the Medline (1966-2014) and Web of Science (1945-2014) databases were searched to identify relevant articles; select articles were also cross-referenced. Articles selected were those that provided background, history, descriptive analysis, and application of bibliometric principles and metrics to medical science and health care. No attempt was made to cover all areas exhaustively; rather, key articles were chosen that illustrate bibliometric concepts and enhance the reader's knowledge. It is important that faculty and researchers understand the limitations and appropriate uses of bibliometric data. Bibliometrics has considerable potential as a research area for health care scientists and practitioners that can be used to discover new information about academic trends, pharmacotherapy, disease, and broader health sciences trends.",,34873371|34660616|34615625|34541276|34306245|34239441|34150972|34109284|34046238|33995056|33897259|33802834|33737903|33717952|33489662|33488420|33329962|33166272|32754061|32357468|32174808|32016121|31811603|31762442|31660258|31210726|30962635|30759753|30386407|30092158|29925353|29901549|29642147|28603233|28320410|28153037|28096979|27843745|27724920|27579264,24592695|23840840|20061001|31204025|25927511|23979085

We compared the content coverage and practical utility of PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. The official Web pages of the databases were used to extract information on the range of journals covered, search facilities and restrictions, and update frequency. We used the example of a keyword search to evaluate the usefulness of these databases in biomedical information retrieval and a specific published article to evaluate their utility in performing citation analysis. All databases were practical in use and offered numerous search facilities. PubMed and Google Scholar are accessed for free. The keyword search with PubMed offers optimal update frequency and includes online early articles; other databases can rate articles by number of citations, as an index of importance. For citation analysis, Scopus offers about 20% more coverage than Web of Science, whereas Google Scholar offers results of inconsistent accuracy. PubMed remains an optimal tool in biomedical electronic research. Scopus covers a wider journal range, of help both in keyword searching and citation analysis, but it is currently limited to recent articles (published after 1995) compared with Web of Science. Google Scholar, as for the Web in general, can help in the retrieval of even the most obscure information but its use is marred by inadequate, less often updated, citation information.",,34899122|34886283|34837679|34834300|34827780|34770008|34769604|34765132|34746846|34744707|34733737|34723831|34691329|34684649|34683354|34682602|34671257|34660616|34646202|34615625|34586077|34581676|34499195|34465930|34463089|34381864|34371819|34330280|34300467|34281030|34249800|34239441|34204419|34191108|34188380|34177744|34145020|34127872|34109284|34064749|33979776|33913344|33849636|33836752|33828589|33808855|33801013|33789739|33766073|33730069|33686330|33670121|33648978|33626246|33531720|33505620|33456760|33450104|33401394|33397377|33357085|33354331|33324526|33295280|33285883|33256719|33244415|33241154|33240559|33237878|33224964|33219880|33205082|33197230|33167977|33163536|33163460|33152034|33139966|33134495|33123578|33116761|33102810|33089195|33031632|33019485|32987162|32915714|32905259|32904414|32879522|32868982|32832546|32807154|32775695|32773916|32772149|32738881|32727479|32723366|32709237|32705978|32695099|32684943|32610747|32606102|32604805|32581976|32517087|32483219|32477690|32476989|32456654|32426151|32411858|32384901|32370140|32357468|32344668|32332609|32294089|32265754|32260243|32245367|32219575|32215326|32214549|32204347|32188637|32179730|32063731|32038995|31992557|31983157|31914037|31890240|31865588|31864346|31832075|31823031|31815620|31766728|31695632|31652750|31619279|31614060|31543728|31511806|31488065|31470803|31384996|31285923|31277163|31272504|31258772|31247926|31223567|31203394|31178733|31138250|31118003|31115720|31111281|31110624|31103905|31101059|31095553|31088296|31087256|30950797|30940832|30899186|30800284|30744641|30737574|30724614|30623044|30564922|30526510|30521012|30513943|30459681|30409223|30386407|30377667|30348077|30287898|30194569|30181840|30151224|30140437|30087809|30078380|30010750|29996540|29982543|29967745|29925353|29915945|29915944|29914447|29881545|29879464|29850587|29755907|29713462|29692823|29637087|29599984|29563426|29562909|29517962|29490646|29464369|29463974|29444130|29387147|29385197|29371846|29340178|29264408|29234533|29186043|29179733|29162147|29121222|29114112|29095254|29043556|28979201|28972802|28935236|28856028|28852981|28804177|28774315|28725096|28683764|28596628|28593477|28558687|28542584|28479969|28392812|28392739|28342906|28331838|28320410|28288686|28231792|28179007|28153037|28126030|28100272|28096979|28086974|27973611|27899145|27884199|27866473|27844151|27843745|27835703|27724920|27663999|27652054|27618122|27532743|27504147|27478725|27420065|27382475|27366448|27275188|27267256|27235131|27215352|27189233|27158823|27154247|27095075|26921290|26887690|26819840|26770709|26674984|26667087|26656243|26637465|26622289|26601251|26543761|26468423|26445656|26421238|26379270|26374806|26341635|26337534|26306540|26301066|26277112|26224091|26208117|26172553|26142742|26107458|26060621|26038727|25984946|25949270|25933180|25928238|25915521|25888877|25852167|25690674|25686064|25674458|25671116|25617516|25554521|25525498|25348511|25345894|25263231|25182125|25148888|25091931|25075237|25050176|25013748|25005130|24976952|24975597|24971257|24920900|24885706|24788259|24766743|24758477|24753798|24725483|24628838|24622198|24619625|24558535|24554795|24443999|24379959|24360284|24330690|24167778|24163792|24160679|24072686|24058251|24015029|23948488|23915151|23900628|23772139|23758872|23707966|23439775|23375070|23241168|23198104|23087765|22973370|22964880|22780908|22679453|22434265|22384515|22364509|22230643|22224134|22180873|22126216|22059168|21912995|21837485|21800117|21698195|21659400|21619707|21613620|21493657|21347409|21347167|21339895|21176219|21085482|20665140|20648248|20531223|20459746|20401951|20162739|20126268|18974831,19738094|20401951|16805916|31886636|31710021
32174808,Trends of Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation From 2009 to 2018: A Bibliometric Analysis.,"Zheng, Kang-Yong KY|Dai, Guang-Yan GY|Lan, Yue Y|Wang, Xue-Qiang XQ",Frontiers in neuroscience,2020,"Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) technology, which is amongst the most used non-invasive brain stimulation techniques currently available, has developed rapidly from 2009 to 2018. However, reports on the trends of rTMS using bibliometric analysis are rare. The goal of the present bibliometric analysis is to analyze and visualize the trends of rTMS, including general (publication patterns) and emerging trends (research frontiers), over the last 10 years by using the visual analytic tool CiteSpace V. Publications related to rTMS from 2009 to 2018 were retrieved from the Web of Science (WoS) database, including 2,986 peer-reviewed articles/reviews. Active authors, journals, institutions, and countries were identified by WoS and visualized by CiteSpace V, which could also detect burst changes to identify emerging trends. GraphPad Prism 8 was used to analyze the time trend of annual publication outputs. The USA ranked first in this field. Pascual-Leone A (author A), Fitzgerald PB (author B), George MS (author C), Lefaucheur JP (author D), and Fregni F (author E) made great contributions to this field of study. The most prolific institution to publish rTMS-related publications in the last decade was the University of Toronto. The journal Brain Stimulation published most papers. Lefaucheur et al.'s paper in 2014, and the keyword ""sham controlled trial"" showed the strongest citation bursts by the end of 2018, which indicates increased attention to the underlying work, thereby indicating the research frontiers. This study reveals the publication patterns and emerging trends of rTMS based on the records published from 2009 to 2018. The insights obtained have reference values for the future research and application of rTMS.",30769128|12937078|26594073|30352528|14724295|28479858|20160893|22661405|30264518|19696930|30773896|17573044|30661940|22508405|28598858|20585474|16779135|16857577|19079129|16390894|31133889|21414995|22713491|17368094|25387001|14977202|17673361|21056619|14645480|31082456|29110687|31762442|18801225|17079517|12478392|23154644|27689549|16275915|21538653|20478978|28028801|17978325|16890483|19859782|25175159|26349810|25797650|27655008|8684201|15056717|17655557|12727683|15664172|31068784|22658708|18223016|21474597|29137328|25206333|26382227|17046606|20633383|31092060|22443895|19693003|18845611|25034472|17640522|21593336|25940769|10802449|25465290|15911819|19145228|20633391|23623156|30733704|17565358|16809569|29323025|23799477|22483681|22037123|20439832|21527312|23507264|16203702|23827785|18447962|23728683|27021215|14614806|31772566|22410477|27428861|27931886|15766771|23249815|20633392,34581676|34414092|33897259|33488420|32612497,32801848|31762442|33032636|34721179|32215136|33662607

The gut microbiome in the modern environment has markedly changed in response to environmental factors. These changes may affect a broad range of host psychiatric disorders, such as depression, by interacting with the host through metabolic, immune, neural, and endocrine pathways. Nevertheless, the general aspects of the links between the gut microbiota and depression have not been systematically investigated through bibliometric analysis. Aim: This study aimed to analyze the current status and developing trends in gut microbiota research in the depression field through bibliometric and visual analysis. Methods: A total of 1,962 publications published between 1999 and 2019 were retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection. CiteSpace (5.6 R5) was used to perform collaboration network analysis, co-citation analysis, co-occurrence analysis, and citation burst detection. Results: The number of publications has been rapidly growing since 2010. The collaboration network analysis revealed that the USA, University College Cork, and John F. Cryan were the most influential country, institute, and scholar, respectively. The most productive and co-cited journals were Brain Behavior and Immunity and Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, respectively. The co-citation analysis of references revealed that the most recent research focus was in the largest theme cluster, ""cytokines,"" thus reflecting the important research foundation in this field. The co-occurrence analysis of keywords revealed that ""fecal microbiota"" and ""microbiome"" have become the top two research hotspots since 2013. The citation burst detection for keywords identified several keywords, including ""Parkinson's disease,"" ""microbiota-gut-brain axis,"" ""microbiome,"" ""dysbiosis,"" ""bipolar disorder,"" ""impact,"" ""C reactive protein,"" and ""immune system,"" as new research frontiers, which have currently ongoing bursts. Conclusions: These results provide an instructive perspective on the current research and future directions in the study of the links between the gut microbiota and depression, which may help researchers choose suitable cooperators or journals, and promote their research illustrating the underlying molecular mechanisms of depression, including its etiology, prevention, and treatment.",27677781|31896831|28685036|29186317|29041989|30009996|24860551|30396512|12701955|31307473|21876150|22699609|28164854|32296852|30427836|22198405|16779135|25411471|30234616|23384445|31030093|28612257|24888394|15613934|31082716|28069755|20974015|25391942|30065258|26372623|27509521|27098106|30421223|31762442|28717517|24286462|25830558|24370461|26408987|31791704|25882912|16391221|26412067|25862297|23160295|16275915|22968153|20203603|25974299|27751556|30181015|31784958|30155748|32587239|25925913|22688187|32016121|26528128|32332994|31591348|18456279|27013171|30496104|31470803|28336545|11126391|21988661|27405349|25077605|25940769|25525577|22410503|28824167|20015486|30684456|15635412|30306634|17007934|14724295|30718848|28479858|21683077|18073775|31427752|30662368|18283240|15617861|15322027|20603222|27884012|30819194|27647198|32174808|31124390|31456743|20696216|31493613|28669638|29550676|19343057|21054680|29684865|28155119|30396698|29967745|21488225|23759244|31646148|22085595|21282636|32179730|22349578,34859050|34795578|34366917|34239441|34108920|33918462,34239441|30819194|33032636|31470803|34721179|33866438
