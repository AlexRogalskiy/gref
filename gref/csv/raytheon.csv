This comparison was conducted in support of the calibration of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) instruments. The radiometric scale assigned to the Spherical Integrating Source (SIS100) by SBRS was validated through a comparison with radiometric measurements made by a number of stable, well-characterized transfer radiometers from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Goddard Space Flight Center (NASA's GSFC), and the University of Arizona Optical Sciences Center (UA). The measured radiances from the radiometers differed by ±3 % in the visible to near infrared when compared to the SBRS calibration of the sphere, and the overall agreement was within the combined uncertainties of the individual measurements. In general, the transfer radiometers gave higher values than the SBRS calibration in the near infrared and lower values in the blue. The measurements of the radiometers differed by ±4 % from 800 nm to 1800 nm compared to the SBRS calibration of the sphere, and the overall agreement was within the combined uncertainties of the individual measurements for wavelengths less than 2200 nm.

Researchers from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration/Goddard Space Flight Center (NASA/GSFC), the University of Arizona Optical Sciences Center (UA), and the National Research Laboratory of Metrology (NRLM) in Tsukuba, Japan used their portable radiometers to measure the spectral radiance of the OCTS visible and near-infrared integrating sphere at four radiance levels. These four levels corresponded to the configuration of the OCTS integrating sphere when the calibration coefficients for five of the eight spectral channels, or bands, of the OCTS instrument were determined. The measurements of the four radiometers differed by -2.7 % to 3.9 % when compared to the NEC calibration of the sphere and the overall agreement was within the combined measurement uncertainties. A comparison of the measurements from the participating radiometers also resulted in agreement within the combined measurement uncertainties.

In the first step, the relative spectral response (RSR) of the instrument is determined using a nearly monochromatic light source such as a lamp-illuminated monochromator. These sources do not typically fill the field of view of the instrument nor act as calibrated sources of light. Consequently, they only provide a relative (not absolute) spectral response for the instrument. In the second step, the instrument views a calibrated source of broadband light, such as a lamp-illuminated integrating sphere. The RSR and the sphere's absolute spectral radiance are combined to determine the absolute spectral radiance responsivity (ASR) of the instrument. More recently, a full-aperture absolute calibration approach using widely tunable monochromatic lasers has been developed. Using these sources, the ASR of an instrument can be determined in a single step on a wavelength-by-wavelength basis. From these monochromatic ASRs, the responses of the instrument bands to broadband radiance sources can be calculated directly, eliminating the need for calibrated broadband light sources such as lamp-illuminated integrating spheres. In this work, the traditional broadband source-based calibration of the Suomi National Preparatory Project Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite sensor is compared with the laser-based calibration of the sensor.

Silicon detectors can be calibrated in the visible spectral region with combined standard uncertainties at the 0.1% level. However, uncertainties increase dramatically when measuring an instrument's spectral irradiance or radiance responsivity. We describe what we believe to be a new laser-based facility for spectral irradiance and radiance responsivity calibrations using uniform sources (SIRCUS) that was developed to calibrate instruments directly in irradiance or radiance mode with uncertainties approaching or exceeding those available for spectral power responsivity calibrations. In SIRCUS, the emission from high-power, tunable lasers is introduced into an integrating sphere using optical fibers, producing uniform, quasi-Lambertian, high-radiant-flux sources. Reference standard irradiance detectors, calibrated directly against national primary standards for spectral power responsivity and aperture area measurement, are used to determine the irradiance at a reference plane. Knowing the measurement geometry, the source radiance can be readily determined as well. The radiometric properties of the SIRCUS source coupled with state-of-the-art transfer standard radiometers whose responses are directly traceable to primary national radiometric scales result in typical combined standard uncertainties in irradiance and radiance responsivity calibrations of less than 0.1%.

However, cross-calibration is not sufficiently accurate, since the effects of the differences in the sensor's spectral and spatial responses are not fully mitigated. The present study attempts to evaluate radiometric consistency across two sensors using an improved cross-calibration algorithm to address the spectral and spatial effects and derive cross-calibration-based RCCs, which increases the ASTER calibration accuracy. Overall, radiances measured with ASTER bands 1 and 2 are on averages 3.9% and 3.6% greater than the ones measured on the same scene with their MODIS counterparts and ASTER band 3N (nadir) is 0.6% smaller than its MODIS counterpart in current radiance/reflectance products. The percentage root mean squared errors (%RMSEs) between the radiances of two sensors are 3.7, 4.2, and 2.3 for ASTER band 1, 2, and 3N, respectively, which are slightly greater or smaller than the required ASTER radiometric calibration accuracy (4%). The uncertainty of the cross-calibration is analyzed by elaborating the error budget table to evaluate the International System of Units (SI)-traceability of the results.

In the first application, the tunable lasers are used to calibrate the spectral power responsivities of primary standard detectors against an absolute cryogenic radiometer (ACR). The second function is to calibrate the absolute radiance and irradiance responsivities of detectors with uniform light sources, typically generated by coupling the laser light into integrating spheres. The radiant flux from the uniform sources is determined by the ACR-calibrated primary standard detectors. Together these sources and detectors are used to transfer radiometric scales to a variety of optical instruments with low uncertainties. We describe methods for obtaining the stable, uniform light sources required for low uncertainty measurements along with advances in laser sources that facilitate tuning over broader wavelength ranges.

It has the advantages of relative portability and a collimated beam (low Ã©tendue), and is an alternative to conventional sources such as tungsten lamps, blackbodies, or tunable lasers. The supercontinuum laser is a commercial Fianium SC400-6-02, which has a wavelength range between 400 and 2500 nm and a total power of 6 W. The wavelength tunable bandpass filter, a PhotonEtc laser line tunable filter (LLTF), is tunable between 400 and 1000 nm and has a bandwidth of 1 or 2 nm depending on the wavelength selected.

Concurrently, a lunar irradiance model has been developed by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) from extensive Earth-based observations of the Moon. The lunar irradiances measured by SeaWiFS are compared with the USGS model. The comparison shows essentially identical response histories for SeaWiFS, with differences from the model of less than 0.05% per thousand days in the long-term trends. From the SeaWiFS experience we have learned that it is important to view the entire lunar image at a constant phase angle from measurement to measurement and to understand, as best as possible, the size of each lunar image. However, a constant phase angle is not required for using the USGS model. With a long-term satellite lunar data set it is possible to determine instrument changes at a quality level approximating that from the USGS lunar model. However, early in a mission, when the dependence on factors such as phase and libration cannot be adequately determined from satellite measurements alone, the USGS model is critical to an understanding of trends in instruments that use the Moon for calibration.

A sun photometer is usually calibrated by using a lamp-illuminated integrating sphere source for its band-averaged radiance responsivity, which normally has an uncertainty of 3%-5% at present. Considering the calibration coefficients may also change with time, a regular high precision calibration is important to maintain data quality. In this paper, a tunable-laser-based facility for spectral radiance responsivity calibration has been developed at the Key Laboratory of Optical Calibration and Characterization, Chinese Academy of Sciences. A reference standard radiance radiometer, calibrated against cryogenic radiometer, is used to determine the radiance from a laser-illuminated integrating sphere source. Spectral radiance responsivity of CIMEL CE318-2 sun photometer is calibrated using this new calibration system with a combined standard uncertainty of about 0.8%.

CERES radiometers are designed to make stable broadband measurements of scattered solar and emitted thermal radiative flux leaving Earth with an accuracy of 1% or better. Using versatile and programmable scan modes, it is also possible for every CERES instrument to view the Moon on each orbit. However, until now, it has not been possible to derive absolute measurements of lunar irradiance using CERES because the Moon's disk fills only 10% of the telescope field of view. This work presents a method of integrating CERES raster-scan data in order to obtain a measurement of the average scattered solar and emitted thermal radiance from the entire lunar disk. The technique results in excellent agreement between CERES instruments on different satellites as to lunar albedo and emitted thermal flux. The average broadband Moon albedo is measured by CERES at a value of 0.1362 (+/-2-3%) when normalized to a static lunar phase angle of 7 degrees using the U.S. Geological Survey lunar irradiance Robotic Lunar Observatory model. The method for the first time also yields very accurate measurements of the thermal irradiance emitted from the Moon. These suggest an average long-wave flux of 977 Wm(-2) (+/-2-3% at 7 degrees phase), implying an approximate mean surface temperature of around 92 degrees C. Statistical analysis on available data suggests that a CERES instrument performing monthly lunar measurements could utilize the Moon as a stability target and reduce calibration drifts to 0.3% per decade or less within an instrument's lifetime. Given the success of the technique, a solar calibration system is proposed that will allow precise tracking of an ERB instrument's optical degradation using the Sun.",,26034697,15540442|18301626|26900523|29522016|25968375

This KOMPSAT-3A required calibration and validation (Cal/Val) before and after its launch to enable proper functional characterization and to maintain the veracity of data collected. The Korea Aerospace Research Institute (KARI) executed the initial prelaunch calibration in the laboratory and we performed the Cal/Val of KOMPSAT-3A during the Launch and Early Operation Phase (LEOP) in the field. Two suitable sites in Korea and Mongolia with stable weather, almost uniform terrain, and near Lambertian diffusion, provided the necessary tarp reflectance to calculate the absolute radiometric calibration coefficients. The surface reflectance was determined using 12 and four well-calibrated reference reflectance tarps employing the FieldSpecÂ® 3(Analytical Spectral Devices Inc., Boulder, CO, USA) Spectroradiometer. Subsequently, the top of atmosphere (TOA) radiance was estimated using radiative transfer code (RTC) software based on the Atmospheric and Topographic Correction (ATCOR). In addition, cross calibration was simultaneously performed at the Libya-4 pseudo invariant calibration site (PICS) for KOMPSAT-3A TOA radiance, using the spectral band adjustment factor (SBAF) compensated Landsat 8 reflectance and the Second Simulation of Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum (6S) to compute cross calibration coefficients. The results of the KOMPSAT-3A absolute calibration coefficient show that the R2 values were over 0.99, implying a significant correlation for almost all bands between the TOA radiance and the KOMPSAT-3A spectral band response at both campaign sites. However, this study reveals a difference of less than 5% calibration gains for all bands compared to the prelaunch values, while the cross calibration gain is below 5% in visible bands and above 5% in the near infrared band. An effort to optimize the reliability of the absolute calibration coefficients resorted to the rigorous quantification of uncertainties amongst atmospheric conditions, the digital number (DN), the reflectance tarp, the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF), and ozone levels. Therefore, we presumed that the total uncertainty was 4.27%, which conforms to some published results.",17579701|18195970,,27783054|32403627|32020954|33114888|32020955

Subsequent ray trace modeling indicated that large diattenuation on the edges of the bandpass for these spectral bands was the driver behind these large sensitivities. Additional testing using the National Institute of Standards and Technology's Traveling Spectral Irradiance and Radiance Responsivity Calibrations Using Uniform Sources was added to the test program to verify and enhance the model. The testing was limited in scope to two spectral bands at two scan angles; nonetheless, this additional testing provided valuable insight into the polarization sensitivity. Analysis has shown that the derived diattenuation agreed with the broadband measurements to within an absolute difference of about 0.4% and that the ray trace model reproduced the general features of the measured data.

In this study, we conducted an inter-comparison of two remote sensing products, namely, visible/near-infrared surface reflectances and spectral vegetation indices (VIs), from the high resolution Advanced Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) (15 m) and lower resolution Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) (250 m - 500 m) sensors onboard the Terra platform. Our analysis was aimed at understanding the degree of radiometric compatibility between the two sensors' products due to sensor spectral bandpasses and product generation algorithms. Multiple pairs of ASTER and MODIS standard surface reflectance products were obtained at randomly-selected, globally-distributed locations, from which two types of VIs were computed: the normalized difference vegetation index and the enhanced vegetation indices with and without a blue band. Our results showed that these surface reflectance products and the derived VIs compared well between the two sensors at a global scale, but subject to systematic differences, of which magnitudes varied among scene pairs. An independent assessment of the accuracy of ASTER and MODIS standard products, in which ""in-house"" surface reflectances were obtained using in situ Aeronet atmospheric data for comparison, suggested that the performance of the ASTER atmospheric correction algorithm may be variable, reducing overall quality of its standard reflectance product. Atmospheric aerosols, which were not corrected for in the ASTER algorithm, were found not to impact the quality of the derived reflectances.

Herein, through onboard calibration data analysis, the calibration diffuser performance remains stable without degradation, and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on Terra is adopted as a reference to repeatedly verify onboard radiometric calibration results by selecting different dates and reflectance scenes. The SCS equivalent reflectance is obtained by combining the mean digital number (DN) of the SCS crossing area image with the radiometric calibration coefficient. The spectral reflectance is obtained via interpolation and iteration, which is adopted as the actual MODIS incident pupil spectral reflectance because the small imaging time interval can be ignored and almost vertically observed, and it is convoluted with the MODIS spectral response function to obtain the predicted equivalent reflectance. Validation is completed by comparing the predicted MODIS equivalent reflectance to the measured value based on the onboard calibration coefficient. The results show that (1) the difference between the measured and predicted MODIS band equivalent reflectance is between -0.00466 and 0.0039, and (2) the percentage difference between the measured and predicted MODIS band equivalent reflectance ranges from 4.17% and 1.24%, indicating that the calibration system carried on HY-1C can perform high-precision SCS radiometric calibration, meeting the cross-calibration accuracy requirements of other loads on the same platform.",,,28117745|28777329|27505382|24287529|32365984|32742051

Radiometric sensitivity is defined as the output from the instrument (or from one of the instrument bands) per unit spectral radiance at the instrument's input aperture. Knowledge of the long-term repeatability of the SeaWiFS measurements is crucial to maintaining the quality of the ocean scenes derived from measurements by the instrument. For SeaWiFS bands 1-6 (412-670 nm), the change in radiometric sensitivity is less than 0.2% for the period from November 1997 through November 1998. For band 7 (765 nm), the change is approximately 1.5% and for band 8 (865 nm) approximately 5%.

The scatter in the data points about the trend lines in this analysis is less than 0.3% for all eight SeaWiFS bands. These results are based on monthly measurements of the moon. Daily solar measurements using an onboard diffuser show that the radiometric sensitivities of the SeaWiFS bands have changed smoothly during the time intervals between lunar measurements.

Ideally, the Landsat data record should be consistent over the Landsat sensor series. The Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) has improved calibration, signal to noise characteristics, higher 12-bit radiometric resolution, and spectrally narrower wavebands than the previous Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+). Reflective wavelength differences between the two Landsat sensors depend also on the surface reflectance and atmospheric state which are difficult to model comprehensively. The orbit and sensing geometries of the Landsat-8 OLI and Landsat-7 ETM+ provide swath edge overlapping paths sensed only one day apart. The overlap regions are sensed in alternating backscatter and forward scattering orientations so Landsat bi-directional reflectance effects are evident but approximately balanced between the two sensors when large amounts of time series data are considered. Taking advantage of this configuration a total of 59 million 30m corresponding sensor observations extracted from 6,317 Landsat-7 ETM+ and Landsat-8 OLI images acquired over three winter and three summer months for all the conterminous United States (CONUS) are compared. Results considering different stages of cloud and saturation filtering, and filtering to reduce one day surface state differences, demonstrate the importance of appropriate per-pixel data screening. Top of atmosphere (TOA) and atmospherically corrected surface reflectance for the spectrally corresponding visible, near infrared and shortwave infrared bands, and derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), are compared and their differences quantified. On average the OLI TOA reflectance is greater than the ETM+ TOA reflectance for all bands, with greatest differences in the near-infrared (NIR) and the shortwave infrared bands due to the quite different spectral response functions between the sensors. The atmospheric correction reduces the mean difference in the NIR and shortwave infrared but increases the mean difference in the visible bands. Regardless of whether TOA or surface reflectance are used to generate NDVI, on average, for vegetated soil and vegetation surfaces (0 ≤ NDVI ≤ 1), the OLI NDVI is greater than the ETM+ NDVI. Statistical functions to transform between the comparable sensor bands and sensor NDVI values are presented so that the user community may apply them in their own research to improve temporal continuity between the Landsat-7 ETM+ and Landsat-8 OLI sensor data. The transformation functions were developed using ordinary least squares (OLS) regression and were fit quite reliably (r 2 values >0.7 for the reflectance data and >0.9 for the NDVI data, p-values <0.0001).",16926910|19425097|20372238,34219822|34183663|33976255|33738573|33265435|32963240|32943798|32109951|31918454,32020955|21942048|15305688|29449747|26110405

Differences between the solar and lunar data sets have been used to identify issues and verify improvements in each. Linearization of the counts-to-radiance conversion yields a more consistent calibration at low radiance levels. Correction of a recently identified error in the VIIRS solar unit vector coordinate frame has been incorporated into the solar data and diffuser screen transmission functions. Temporal trends in the solar diffuser stability monitor data have been evaluated and addressed. Fits to the solar calibration time series show mean residuals per band of 0.067%-0.17%. Periodic residuals in the VIIRS lunar data are confirmed to arise from a wavelength-dependent libration effect for the sub-spacecraft point in the output of the U.S. Geological Survey Robotic Lunar Observatory photometric model of the Moon.

Fits to the lunar calibration time series, incorporating sub-spacecraft point libration corrections, show mean residuals per band of 0.069%-0.20%. Lunar calibrations have been used to adjust the solar-derived radiometric corrections for bands M1, M3, and M4. After all corrections, the relative differences in the solar and lunar calibrations for bands M1-M7 are 0.093%-0.22%. The OBPG has achieved a radiometric stability for the VIIRS on-orbit calibration that is commensurate with those achieved for SeaWiFS and Aqua MODIS, supporting the incorporation of VIIRS data into the long-term NASA ocean color data record.",,32818076|31380374|29933641|29276312,30461732|26368755|25967622|25608208|26560590

Direct techniques.,"Barnes, R A RA|Eplee, R E RE|Schmidt, G M GM|Patt, F S FS|McClain, C R CR",Applied optics,2001 Dec 20,"We present an overview of the calibration of the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of View Sensor (SeaWiFS) from its performance verification at the manufacturer's facility to the completion of its third year of on-orbit measurements. These calibration procedures have three principal parts: a prelaunch radiometric calibration that is traceable to the National Institute of Standards and Technology; the Transfer-to-Orbit Experiment, a set of measurements that determine changes in the instrument's calibration from its manufacture to the start of on-orbit operations; and measurements of the sun and the moon to determine radiometric changes on orbit. To our knowledge, SeaWiFS is the only instrument that uses routine lunar measurements to determine changes in its radiometric sensitivity. On the basis of these methods, the overall uncertainty in the SeaWiFS top-of-the-atmosphere radiances is estimated to be 4-5%. We also show the results of comparison campaigns with aircraft- and ground-based measurements, plus the results of an experiment, called the Southern Ocean Band 8 Gain Study. These results are used to check the calibration of the SeaWiFS bands. To date, they have not been used to change the instrument's prelaunch calibration coefficients. In addition to these procedures, SeaWiFS is a vicariously calibrated instrument for ocean-color measurements. In the vicarious calibration of the SeaWiFS visible bands, the calibration coefficients are modified to force agreement with surface truth measurements from the Marine Optical Buoy, which is moored off the Hawaiian Island of Lanai. This vicarious calibration is described in a companion paper.",,28804228|28804202,18354559|23262612|18364981|18323952|12665095
32020955,Preliminary analysis of the performance of the Landsat 8/OLI land surface reflectance product.,"Vermote, Eric E|Justice, Chris C|Claverie, Martin M|Franch, Belen B",Remote sensing of environment,2016 Apr 28,"The surface reflectance, i.e., satellite derived top of atmosphere (TOA) reflectance corrected for the temporally, spatially and spectrally varying scattering and absorbing effects of atmospheric gases and aerosols, is needed to monitor the land surface reliably. For this reason, the surface reflectance, and not TOA reflectance, is used to generate the greater majority of global land products, for example, from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) sensors. Even if atmospheric effects are minimized by sensor design, atmospheric effects are still challenging to correct. In particular, the strong impact of aerosols in the Visible and Near Infrared spectral range can be difficult to correct, because they can be highly discrete in space and time (e.g., smoke plumes) and because of the complex scattering and absorbing properties of aerosols that vary spectrally and with aerosol size, shape, chemistry and density. This paper presents the Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) atmospheric correction algorithm that has been developed using the Second Simulation of the Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum Vectorial (6SV) model, refined to take advantage of the narrow OLI spectral bands (compared to Thematic Mapper/Enhanced Thematic Mapper (TM/ETM+)), improved radiometric resolution and signal-to-noise. In addition, the algorithm uses the new OLI Coastal aerosol band (0.433-0.450μm), which is particularly helpful for retrieving aerosol properties, as it covers shorter wavelengths than the conventional Landsat, TM and ETM+ blue bands. A cloud and cloud shadow mask has also been developed using the ""cirrus"" band (1.360-1.390 μm) available on OLI, and the thermal infrared bands from the Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) instrument. The performance of the surface reflectance product from OLI is analyzed over the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) sites using accurate atmospheric correction (based on in situ measurements of the atmospheric properties), by comparison with the MODIS Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) adjusted surface reflectance product and by comparison of OLI derived broadband albedo from United States Surface Radiation Budget Network (US SURFRAD) measurements.",16926910|17579701|18449285,34770504|34750391|34650347|34579374|34545093|34504894|34430081|34357943|34327008|34219830|34219822|34203863|34183663|33976255|33876758|33435223|33343084|33293894|33228080|33182014|33158170|32963240|32704488|32704392|32661444|32187201|32076393|31967369|31918454|30989385,32020954|30142203|33154713|27879830|33114883

Calibration coefficients.,"Barnes, Robert A RA|Zalewski, Edward F EF",Applied optics,2003 Mar 20,"We present a calibration approach for the Sea-Viewing Wide Field-of-View Sensor (SeaWiFS) based on the reflectance properties of the instrument's onboard diffuser. This technique uses SeaWiFS as a reflectometer, measuring the reflected solar irradiance from the Earth and from the onboard diffuser. Because the Sun is the common source of light for both measurements, the ratio of the SeaWiFS-measured radiances from the Earth and the diffuser provide the ratio for the reflectances of the two samples. The reflectance characterization of the onboard diffuser is the calibration reference for this approach. Knowledge of the value of the solar irradiance is not required for these measurements because it falls out of the ratio. Knowledge of the absolute calibration coefficient for the SeaWiFS measurements of each of the two samples is not required either. Instead, the result of the ratioing technique is based on the linearity of the instrument's response to the intensity of the input light. The calibration requires knowledge, however, of the reflectance of the onboard diffuser at the start of the SeaWiFS mission and the response of the instrument bands, in digital numbers, for measurements of the diffuser at that time.",,,12665095|17279164|18354559|18364980|18323952

It is a useful method for evaluating the performance of optical sensors onboard satellites orbiting the Earth. Lunar calibration provides sufficient radiometric calibration opportunities without requiring any special equipment, and is suitable for nano/microsatellites. This study applies lunar calibration to a multispectral sensor, Ocean Observation Camera (OOC), on board a microsatellite named Rapid International Scientific Experiment Satellite. Simulating the brightness of the Moon based on the RObotic Lunar Observatory and SELENE/Spectrum Profiler models, sensitivity degradation was proven to be negligible in any of the four spectral bands of the OOC with the sensor temperature correction. A bluing trend in the OOC's sensor sensitivity was revealed, indicating a shorter observation wavelength shows larger irradiance. Comparing the top-of-atmosphere reflectance of Railroad Valley Playa with the Radiometric Calibration Network dataset revealed that the derived calibration parameter from the lunar calibration was valid for correcting the bluing trend in the visible range.

The SD reflectance degrades over time due to the exposure to solar ultraviolet radiation. The uncertainties embedded in characterizing the SD bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) directly affect the accuracy of sensor radiometric calibration coefficients, such as F-factors, which are proxies of detector gain. The Moon-based radiometric calibration provides an independent way of validating and correcting the SD-based calibration. This study focuses on the comparison of the long-term SD F-factors with lunar F-factors by using two independent lunar irradiance models, i.e., Miller and Turner (MT) model and the Global Space-based Inter-Calibration System Implementation of ROLO (GIRO) model. To monitor the long-term detector response changes, the lunar F-factor differences are matched to the SD F-factors by applying the best fit scaling factors. Overall, the two lunar F-factors agree well, within 2% of one sigma standard deviation in the reflective solar bands compared to the SD F-factors. The lifetime standard deviations of difference between the GIRO-based lunar and SD F-factors show better long-term match than that of MT-based lunar F-factors. The GIRO-based lunar F-factors show increasing differences over time in comparison with the SD F-factors especially for bands M1 to M4, which indicates the underestimation of the VIIRS detector degradation by SD F-factors for these bands. Using standard SD calibration method and the GIRO-based lunar model, long-term difference between the lunar and SD F-factors shows there are 1.6%, 1.3%, 1.0%, and 0.9% increases in lunar F-factor trend for bands M1 to M4 at the end of year 2015. To mitigate these time-dependent biases, NOAA Ocean Color (OC) group and NASA VIIRS characterization support team (VCST) developed lunar correction methods and applied them to their specific products. However, the amounts of band-dependent lunar corrections are not consistent between these two teams, especially in the short-wavelength bands from M1 to M4, depending on the versions of lunar models and SD F-factor calculation algorithms. Using the standard SD F-factor algorithm and the multi-agency endorsed GIRO model, we derived lunar correction factors based on the quadratic fits between the SD and lunar F-factors.

Conversion to radiance.,"Barnes, Robert A RA|Zalewski, Edward F EF",Applied optics,2003 Mar 20,"For instruments that carry onboard solar diffusers to orbit, such as the Sea-Viewing Wide Field-of-View Sensor (SeaWiFS), it is possible to convert the instrument's reflectance measurements to radiance measurements by knowledge of the solar irradiance. This process, which generally requires the application of a solar irradiance model, is described. The application of the irradiance model is separate from the measurements by the instrument and from the instrument's reflectance calibration. In addition, SeaWiFS was calibrated twice before launch for radiance response by use of radiance sources with calibrations traceable to the National Institute of Standards and Technology. With the inclusion of the at-launch diffuser-based radiance calibration, SeaWiFS has three possible radiance calibrations forthe start of on-orbit operations. The combination of these three into a single calibration requires changes of 4% or less for the current at-launch radiance calibration of the instrument.

The validation process requires understanding the photochemical properties of the pathogens of concern and the challenge microorganisms used to represent them. Specifically for polychromatic UV systems, the organisms' dose responses to UV light and their sensitivity across the UV spectrum must be known. This research measured the UV spectral sensitivity, called action spectra, of Cryptosporidium parvum, and MS2, T1UV, Q Beta, T7, and T7m Coliphages, as well as Bacillus pumilus spores. A tunable laser from the National Institute of Standards and Technology was used to isolate single UV wavelengths at 10 nm intervals between 210 and 290 nm. Above 240 nm, all bacteria and viruses tested exhibited a relative peak sensitivity between 260 and 270 nm. Of the coliphage, MS2 exhibited the highest relative sensitivity below 240 nm, relative to its sensitivity at 254 nm, followed by Q Beta, T1UV, T7m and T7 coliphage. B. pumilus spores were more sensitive to UV light at 220 nm than any of the coliphage. These spectra are required for calculating action spectra correction factors for medium pressure UV system validation, for matching appropriate challenge microorganisms to pathogens, and for improving UV dose monitoring. Additionally, understanding the dose response of these organisms at multiple wavelengths can improve polychromatic UV dose calculations and enable prediction of pathogen inactivation from wavelength-specific disinfection technologies such as UV light emitting diodes (LEDs).",,34785646|34495736|34198857|33779994|33643774|33484873|32752793|32741425|30952663|30690218|27889622|26712541,16295846|15537023|24266597|27889622|26712541

Basic information about subnival vegetation distribution and rates of ecosystem change are not known, yet such information is needed to understand relationships between subnival ecology and water/carbon cycles. We show that HKH subnival ecosystems cover five to 15 times the area of permanent glaciers and snow, highlighting their eco-hydrological importance. Using satellite data from the Landsat 5, 7 and 8 missions, we measured change in the spatial extent of subnival vegetation from 1993 to 2018. The Landsat surface reflectance-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index product was thresholded at 0.1 to indicate the presence/absence of vegetation. Using this product, the strength and direction of time-series trends in the green pixel fraction were measured within three regions of interest. We controlled for cloud cover, snow cover and evaluated the impact of sensor radiometric differences between Landsat 7 and Landsat 8. Using Google Earth Engine to expedite data processing tasks, we show that there has been a weakly positive increase in the extent of subnival vegetation since 1993. Strongest and most significant trends were found in the height region of 5,000-5,500 m a.s.l. across the HKH extent: R2  = .302, Kendall's τ = 0.424, p < .05, but this varied regionally, with height, and according to the sensors included in the time series. Positive trends at lower elevations occurred on steeper slopes whilst at higher elevations, flatter areas exhibited stronger trends. We validated our findings using online photographs.

To improve its disinfection efficacy, more information on the mechanisms of UV inactivation on microorganisms at wavelengths throughout the germicidal UV spectrum, particularly at below 240 nm, is necessary. This work examined UV inactivation of bacteriophage MS2, a common surrogate for enteric pathogens, as a function of wavelength. The bacteriophage was exposed to monochromatic UV irradiation from a tunable laser at wavelengths of between 210 nm and 290 nm. To evaluate the mechanisms of UV inactivation throughout this wavelength range, RT-qPCR (reverse transcription-quantitative PCR) was performed to measure genomic damage for comparison with genomic damage at 253.7 nm. The results indicate that the rates of RNA damage closely mirror the loss of viral infectivity across the germicidal UV spectrum.

The SeaWiFS diffuser is an aluminum plate coated with YB71 paint. The bidirectional reflectance distribution function of the diffuser was not fully characterized before launch, so the Cal/Val team has implemented a regression of the solar incidence angles and the drift in the node of the satellite's orbit against the diffuser time series to correct for solar incidence angle effects. An exponential function with a time constant of 200 days yields the best fit to the diffuser time series. The decrease in diffuser reflectance over the mission is wavelength dependent, ranging from 9% in the blue (412 nm) to 5% in the red and near infrared (670-865 nm). The Cal/Val team has developed a methodology for computing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for SeaWiFS on orbit from the diffuser time series corrected for both the varying solar incidence angles and the diffuser reflectance degradation. A sensor noise model is used to compare on-orbit SNRs computed for radiances reflected from the diffuser with prelaunch SNRs measured at typical radiances specified for the instrument. To within the uncertainties in the measurements, the SNRs for SeaWiFS have not changed over the mission. The on-orbit performance of the SeaWiFS solar diffuser should offer insight into the long-term on-orbit performance of solar diffusers on other instruments, such as the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectrometer [currently flying on the Earth Observing System (EOS) Terra and Aqua satellites], the Visible and Infrared Radiometer Suite [scheduled to fly on the NASA National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS) and NPOESS Preparatory Project (NPP) satellites] and the Advanced Baseline Imager [scheduled to fly on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Geostationary Environmental Operational Satellite Series R (GOES-R) satellites].",,32647655,17882294|12665094|26368755|23262612|27505382

In this comprehensive work we describe the SD-based calibration algorithm of the RSBs, analyze the calibration data, and derive the performance results-the RSB calibration coefficients or F-factors-for the current three and a half years of mission. The application of the newly derived product of the SD bidirectional reflectance factor and the vignetting function for the SD screen and the newly derived SD degradation, so-called H-factors, effectively minimizes the artificial seasonal patterns in the RSB calibration coefficients due to the errors of these ingredient inputs. The full illumination region, the ""sweet spot,"" during calibration events for SD view is carefully examined and selected to ensure high data quality and to reduce noise owing to non-fully illuminated samples. A time-dependent relative spectral response (RSR), coming from the large out-of-band contribution and the VIIRS optical system wavelength-dependent degradation, is derived from an iterative approach and applied in the SD calibration for each RSB. The result shows that VIIRS RSBs degrade much faster at near-infrared (NIR) and shortwave-infrared (SWIR) wavelength ranges due to the faster degradation of the rotating telescope assembly against the remaining part of the system. The gains of the VIIRS RSBs have degraded 2.0% (410 nm, Band M1), 0.2% (443 nm, Band M2), -0.3% (486 nm, Band M3), 0.2% (551 nm, Band M4), 6.2% (640 nm, Band I1), 11.0% (671 nm, Band M5), 21.3% (745 nm, Band M6), 35.8% (862 nm, Band I2), and 35.8% (862 nm, Band M7), respectively, since launch and 24.8% (1238 nm, Band M8), 18.5% (1378 nm, Band M9), 11.5% (1610 nm, Band I3), 11.5% (1610, Band M10), and 4.0% (2250 nm, Band M11), respectively, since 20 January 2012. It is established that the SD calibration accurately catches the on-orbit RSB degradation according to the instrument design and the calibration algorithm. However, due to the inherent nonuniform degradation of the SD affecting especially the short wavelength bands and the lack of capability of the SDSM calibration to catch degradation beyond 935 nm, the direct and the unmitigated application of the SD calibration result will introduce nonnegligible error into the calibration coefficients resulting in long-term drifts in the sensor data records and consequently the high-level products. We explicitly unveil the effect of the nonuniformity in SD degradation in the RSB calibration coefficients but also briefly discuss a critical yet simple mitigation to restore the accuracy of the calibration coefficients based on lunar observations. The methodology presented here thus remains intact as the cornerstone of the RSB calibration, and our derived RSB calibration coefficients represent the optimal result. This work has the most impact on the quality of the ocean color products that sensitively depend on the moderate visible and NIR bands (M1-M7), as well as the SWIR bands (M8, M10, and M11).",,,25608208|25967622|27505382|25968375|30117902

In this procedure, long-term radiometric stability and radiometric accuracy are the two major indicators for radiometric evaluation. The radiometric temporal stability is analyzed by the tendency of long-term top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance variation; the radiometric accuracy is determined by comparison with the TOA reflectance from MODIS after spectrally matching. Three Chinese sensors including the Charge-Coupled Device (CCD) camera onboard Huan Jing 1 satellite (HJ-1), as well as the Visible and Infrared Radiometer (VIRR) and Medium-Resolution Spectral Imager (MERSI) onboard the Feng Yun 3 satellite (FY-3) are evaluated in reflective bands based on this procedure. The results are reasonable, and thus can provide reliable reference for the sensors' application, and as such will promote the development of Chinese satellite data.",,33799978|28777329,25835937|23016343|33114888|32825258|19650442
27505382,Degradation nonuniformity in the solar diffuser bidirectional reflectance distribution function.,"Sun, Junqiang J|Chu, Mike M|Wang, Menghua M",Applied optics,2016 Aug 01,"The assumption of angular dependence stability of the solar diffuser (SD) throughout degradation is critical to the on-orbit calibration of the reflective solar bands (RSBs) in many satellite sensors. Recent evidence has pointed to the contrary, and in this work, we present a thorough investigative effort into the angular dependence of the SD degradation for the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) onboard the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (SNPP) satellite and for the twin Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard Terra and Aqua spacecrafts. One common key step in the RSB calibration is the use of the SD degradation performance measured by an accompanying solar diffuser stability monitor (SDSM) as a valid substitute for the SD degradation factor in the direction of the RSB view. If SD degradations between these two respective directions do not maintain the same relative relationship over time, then the unmitigated use of the SDSM-measured SD degradation factor in the RSB calibration calculation will generate bias, and consequently, long-term drift in derived science products. We exploit the available history of the on-orbit calibration events to examine the response of the SDSM and the RSB detectors to the incident illumination reflecting off SD versus solar declination angle and show that the angular dependency, particularly at short wavelengths, evolves with respect to time. The generalized and the decisive conclusion is that the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) of the SD degrades nonuniformly with respect to both incident and outgoing directions. Thus, the SDSM-based measurements provide SD degradation factors that are biased relative to the RSB view direction with respect to the SD. The analysis also reveals additional interesting phenomena, for example, the sharp behavioral change in the evolving angular dependence observed in Terra MODIS and SNPP VIIRS. For SNPP VIIRS the mitigation for this ""SD degradation nonuniformity effect"" with respect to angles relies on a ""hybrid methodology"" using lunar-based calibration to set the reliable long-term baseline. For MODIS, the use of earth targets in the major release Collection 6 to improve calibration coefficients and time-dependent response-versus-scan-angle characterization inherently averts the use of SD and its associated issues. The work further supports that having an open-close operational capability for the space view door can minimize SD degradation and its associated effects due to solar exposure, and thus provide long-term benefits for maintaining calibration and science data accuracy.",,,26368755|25608208|25967622|30117902|30461732
24266597,Wavelength dependent UV inactivation and DNA damage of adenovirus as measured by cell culture infectivity and long range quantitative PCR.,"Beck, Sara E SE|Rodriguez, Roberto A RA|Linden, Karl G KG|Hargy, Thomas M TM|Larason, Thomas C TC|Wright, Harold B HB",Environmental science & technology,2014,"Adenovirus is regarded as the most resistant pathogen to ultraviolet (UV) disinfection due to its demonstrated resistance to monochromatic, low-pressure (LP) UV irradiation at 254 nm. This resistance has resulted in high UV dose requirements for all viruses in regulations set by the United States Environmental Protection Agency. Polychromatic, medium-pressure (MP) UV irradiation has been shown to be much more effective than 254 nm, although the mechanisms of polychromatic UV inactivation are not completely understood. This research analyzes the wavelength-specific effects of UV light on adenovirus type 2 by analyzing in parallel the reduction in viral infectivity and damage to the viral genome. A tunable laser from the National Institute of Standards and Technology was used to isolate single UV wavelengths. Cell culture infectivity and PCR were employed to quantify the adenoviral inactivation rates using narrow bands of irradiation (<1 nm) at 10 nm intervals between 210 and 290 nm. The inactivation rate corresponding to adenoviral genome damage matched the inactivation rate of adenovirus infectivity at 253.7 nm, 270 nm, 280 nm, and 290 nm, suggesting that damage to the viral DNA was primarily responsible for loss of infectivity at those wavelengths. At 260 nm, more damage to the nucleic acid was observed than reduction in viral infectivity. At 240 nm and below, the reduction of viral infectivity was significantly greater than the reduction of DNA amplification, suggesting that UV damage to a viral component other than DNA contributed to the loss of infectivity at those wavelengths. Inactivation rates were used to develop a detailed spectral sensitivity or action spectrum of adenovirus 2. This research has significant implications for the water treatment industry with regard to polychromatic inactivation of viruses and the development of novel wavelength-specific UV disinfection technologies.",,34495736|34226623|33643774|33490943|33383557|33158066|32911671|32812619|32758747|32752793|31275622|30047962|27889622|26712541,23414457|18978087|17933932|26712541|21131511|23040991
25967622,On-orbit characterization of the VIIRS solar diffuser and solar diffuser screen.,"Sun, Junqiang J|Wang, Menghua M",Applied optics,2015 Jan 10,"We analyze bidirectional reflectance factors (BRF) of the solar diffuser (SD) and vignetting function (VF) of the SD screen (SDS) for on-board calibration of the visible infrared imaging radiometer suite (VIIRS). Specific focus is placed on the products of the BRF and VF, which are the main inputs for calibration of the SD and its accompanying solar diffuser stability monitor (SDSM), which tracks SD degradation. A set of 14 spacecraft yaw maneuvers for the Suomi National Polar-Orbiting Partnership satellite, which houses the VIIRS instrument, was carefully planned and carried out over many orbits to provide the necessary information on the dependence of VIIRS instrument response on solar angles. Along with the prelaunch measurements for the SDS VF and SD BRF, the absolute form of the BRF-VF product is determined for each of the reflective solar bands (RSB) and the SDSM detectors. Consequently, the absolute form of the SDS VF also is obtained from the RSB and SDSM detectors using the yaw maneuver data. The results show that the BRF-VF product for an RSB is independent of the detector, gain status, and half-angle mirror side. The derived VFs from the RSB and the SDSM detectors also show reasonable agreement with each other, as well as with the prelaunch VF measurements, and further demonstrate only geometrical dependence, which, in this work, is characterized by solar angles. The derived calibration coefficients, called the F-factors, from the application of the derived functions in this study show a significantly improved pattern. A small band-dependent residual seasonal fluctuation on the level of âˆ¼0.2%-0.4% remains in the F-factors for each RSB and is further improved by a corrective function with linear dependence on the solar azimuth angle in the nominal attitude instrument coordinate system to the VF. For satellite ocean color remote sensing, on-orbit instrument calibration and characterization are particularly important for producing accurate and consistent ocean color products. The result of this work has the most significant and direct impact on ocean color products.",,,26368755|30117902|25608208|27505382|25968375

Although the lunar calibration is a well-developed technique in the RSBs, limited work has been done for Chinese Earth observation satellites. To improve the on-orbital calibration performance, the advanced MEdium Resolution Spectral Imager (MERSI II), which is the primary payload of the fourth satellite of the Fengyun 3 Series (FY-3D), expands the space view angle of the imager in order to capture better lunar images. In this study, we propose an absolute radiometric calibration method based on the FY-3D/MERSI lunar observation data. A lunar irradiance model named ROLO/GIRO has been used together with the necessary data procedures, including dark current count estimation, single pixel irradiance calculation, and full disk lunar irradiance calculation. The calibration coefficients obtained by the lunar calibration are compared with the pre-launch laboratory calibration. The results show that the deviations between the two calibration procedures are in a reasonable range in general. However, a relatively high non-linear response was found in the low energy incidence for some detectors, which leads to the large deviation in the corresponding bands. This study explored an ideal and independent method to validate MERSI on-orbit radiometric performance. The lunar calibration practiced for MERSI also gave a valuable example that can be recommended to the other Chinese Earth observation satellites.",23262612|30461732,33379278,33379278|23016343|30461732|28117745|33916016

The measurements made with these two radiometers reveal that the NIST spectral irradiance scale as compared with an absolute thermodynamic scale has not changed by more than 1.5% in the visible from 1993 to 1999. Similar measurements in the ultraviolet reveal that the corresponding change is less than 1.5% from 1995 to 1999. Furthermore, a check of the spectral irradiance scale by six different filter radiometers calibrated for absolute spectral irradiance responsivity based on the high-accuracy cryogenic radiometer shows that the agreement between the present scale and the detector-based scale is better than 1.3% throughout the visible to the near-infrared wavelength region.

25608208,Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite solar diffuser calibration and its challenges using a solar diffuser stability monitor.,"Sun, Junqiang J|Wang, Menghua M",Applied optics,2014 Dec 20,"The reflective solar bands (RSB) of the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) on board the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (SNPP) satellite is calibrated by a solar diffuser (SD) whose performance is itself monitored by a solar diffuser stability monitor (SDSM). In this study, we describe the calibration algorithm of the SDSM, analyze the current two and a half years of calibration data, and derive the performance result for the SD, commonly called SD degradation or H-factors. The application of the newly derived vignetting functions for both the SD screen and the SDSM sun-view screen effectively removes the seasonal oscillations in the derived SD degradation and significantly improves the quality of the H-factors. The full illumination region, the so-called ""sweet spot,"" for both SD view and SDSM sun view is carefully examined and selected to ensure a consistent and an optimal number of valid data samples to reduce the sample noise owing to inconsistent or lack of samples. The result shows that SD degrades much faster at short wavelength as expected, about 28.5% at 412 nm but only 1.2% at 935 nm up to date. The performance of the SD degrades exponentially with time until 7 November 2013 but has since become flat. This sudden flattening of the SD degradation is a new phenomenon never previously observed for the degradations of the SD on VIIRS or other satellite sensors. The overall result shows that SDSM is essentially functioning without flaws in catching the on-orbit degradation of the SD. The most significant and direct impact of this work would be on the quality of the ocean color products that depend sensitively on moderate RSB (RSB) (M1-M8, M10, and M11). Two very important and key questions on the performance of the SD are also raised. One pertains to the directional dependence of the SD degradation result, and it is shown that the SD does not degrade uniformly in all directions as has been assumed by all SD calibration analyses. This has a definitive impact on the RSB calibration. Another is on the degradation of the SD at the shortwave infrared (SWIR) wavelengths, and it is shown that the zero degradation input for the RSB calibration would be erroneous. Last, the impact of the stray light on the SD since ""first light"" is cleanly exhibited in the improved SD degradation result.",,,26368755|25967622|27505382|30117902|25968375

Because of the amplification of any sensor calibration errors by the atmospheric correction, the 1% relative accuracy requirement translates into a 0.1% long-term radiometric stability requirement for top-of-the-atmosphere (TOA) radiances. The rigorous prelaunch and on-orbit calibration program developed and implemented for Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) by the NASA Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG) has led to the incorporation of significant changes into the on-orbit calibration methodology over the 13-year lifetime of the instrument. Evolving instrument performance and ongoing algorithm refinement have resulted in updates to approaches for the lunar, solar, and vicarious calibration of SeaWiFS. The uncertainties in the calibrated TOA radiances are addressed in terms of accuracy (biases in the measurements), precision (scatter in the measurements), and stability (repeatability of the measurements). The biases are 2%-3% from lunar calibration and 1%-2% from vicarious calibration. The precision is 0.16% from solar signal-to-noise ratios, 0.13% from lunar residuals, and 0.10% from vicarious gains. The long-term stability of the TOA radiances, derived from the lunar time series, is 0.13%.

The 254 nm emission of low-pressure vacuum lamps is known for its antimicrobial effect, but unfortunately, this radiation is also harmful to human cells. Some researchers published reports that short-wavelength ultraviolet light in the spectral region of 200-230 nm (far-UVC) should inactivate pathogens without harming human cells, which might be very helpful in many applications. Methods: A literature search on the impact of far-UVC radiation on pathogens, cells, skin and eyes was performed and median log-reduction doses for different pathogens and wavelengths were calculated. Observed damage to cells, skin and eyes was collected and presented in standardized form. Results: More than 100 papers on far-UVC disinfection, published within the last 100 years, were found. Far-UVC radiation, especially the 222 nm emission of KrCl excimer lamps, exhibits strong antimicrobial properties. The average necessary log-reduction doses are 1.3 times higher than with 254 nm irradiation. A dose of 100 mJ/cm2 reduces all pathogens by several orders of magnitude without harming human cells, if optical filters block emissions above 230 nm. Conclusion: The approach is very promising, especially for temporary applications, but the data is still sparse. Investigations with high far-UVC doses over a longer period of time have not yet been carried out, and there is no positive study on the impact of this radiation on human eyes.

UV devices emitting UVC irradiation (200 to 280 nm) have proven to be effective for virus disinfection, but limited information is available for SARS-CoV-2 due to the safety requirements of testing, which is limited to biosafety level 3 (BSL3) laboratories. In this study, inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 in thin-film buffered aqueous solution (pH 7.4) was determined across UVC irradiation wavelengths of 222 to 282 nm from krypton chloride (KrCl*) excimers, a low-pressure mercury-vapor lamp, and two UVC light-emitting diodes. Our results show that all tested UVC devices can effectively inactivate SARS-CoV-2, among which the KrCl* excimer had the best disinfection performance (i.e., highest inactivation rate). The inactivation rate constants of SARS-CoV-2 across wavelengths are similar to those for murine hepatitis virus (MHV) from our previous investigation, suggesting that MHV can serve as a reliable surrogate of SARS-CoV-2 with a lower BSL requirement (BSL2) during UV disinfection tests. This study provides fundamental information on UVC's action on SARS-CoV-2 and guidance for achieving reliable disinfection performance with UVC devices. IMPORTANCE UV light is an effective tool to help stem the spread of respiratory viruses and protect public health in commercial, public, transportation, and health care settings. For effective use of UV, there is a need to determine the efficiency of different UV wavelengths in killing pathogens, specifically SARS-CoV-2, to support efforts to control the ongoing COVID-19 global pandemic and future coronavirus-caused respiratory virus pandemics. We found that SARS-CoV-2 can be inactivated effectively using a broad range of UVC wavelengths, and 222 nm provided the best disinfection performance.

30117902,On-orbit characterization of the VIIRS solar diffuser and attenuation screens for NOAA-20 using yaw measurements.,"Sun, Junqiang J|Chu, Mike M|Wang, Menghua M",Applied optics,2018 Aug 01,"The follow-up visible infrared imaging radiometer suite (VIIRS) housed in the NOAA-20 satellite and the first of four in the NOAA Joint Polar Satellite System satellite series, was launched on 18 November 2017. The on-orbit satellite yaw maneuver operation was carried out on 25-26 January 2018 over 15 scheduled orbits to obtain responses of the reflective solar bands (RSBs) and the solar diffuser stability monitor (SDSM) over a specified angular range. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the yaw measurements that characterizes the three required input functions for the standard on-orbit RSB calibration pipeline. The characterization functions of the product of the bidirectional reflectance factors (BRFs) of the solar diffuser (SD) with the vignetting function (VF) of the SD screen (SDS), dubbed the BRF-VF-products (BVPs), are derived for the two required outgoing directions from the SD, one set for the RSB BVPs from the SD to the rotation telescope assembly that directs light to the RSBs, and another set for the SDSM BVPs for the outgoing direction from the SD to the SDSM. The VFs for the attenuation screen placed in front of the Sun-view port, the Sun-view screen (SVS), are analyzed as a set of standalone functions to characterize the direct solar illumination reaching the SDSM through the SVS, but the complexity of their non-smooth two-dimensional dependence requires an additional direct treatment in the derivation of the degradation of the SD, the H-factors. The results for the RSB BVPs, SDSM BVPs, and the SVS VFs are presented and discussed, and further applied to derive the early-mission performance of H-factors and the RSB calibration coefficients, or F-factors. The overall results of the H-factors and F-factors showing smooth trends with negligible residuals indicate that the derived BVP functions and the SVS VFs have been accurately characterized or treated, and are ready for use for the standard on-orbit RSB calibration of NOAA-20 VIIRS.",,,25967622|26368755|32400576|25608208|27505382

However, this DNA-based weighting does not necessarily match the spectral sensitivity of the microorganism being tested. Bacillus subtilis spores are often used for UV reactor validation in Europe, while MS2 coliphage is typically used for validation testing in the United States. These organisms were exposed to quasi-monochromatic UV irradiation across the microbicidal spectrum at wavelengths of 214, 230, 240, 254, 265, 280, and 293 nm. MS2 was three times more sensitive to wavelengths near 214 nm compared to the 254 nm output of low-pressure lamps, while B. subtilis spores were most sensitive to wavelengths around 265 nm. Use of these action spectra, compared to the DNA-based weighting, resulted in differences in the calculated polychromatic UV fluence. Consequently, the action spectrum, which is specific for each microorganism, has implications on the uncertainty of UV fluence determination during validation of reactors with polychromatic UV lamps.",,33643774|31275622|31236005|30123980|30047962|27889622|27498232|26712541|24952878|22327583,19762061|27014964|25506761|26712541|1798752

In this situation, ultraviolet (UVC) disinfection technologies seem to be promising because biocontaminated air and surfaces are the major media for disease transmission. However, UVC is strongly absorbed by human cells and protein components; therefore, there are concerns about damaging plasma components and causing dermatitis and skin cancer. To avoid these concerns, in this study, we demonstrate that the efficient inactivation of bacteria is achieved by visible pulsed light irradiation. The principle of inactivation is based on transient photothermal heating. First, we provide experimental confirmation that extremely high temperatures above 1000 K can be achieved by pulsed laser irradiation. Evidence of this high temperature is directly confirmed by melting gold nanoparticles (GNPs). Inorganic GNPs are used because of their well-established thermophysical properties. Second, we show inactivation behaviour by pulsed laser irradiation. This inactivation behaviour cannot be explained by a simple optical absorption effect. We experimentally and theoretically clarify this inactivation mechanism based on both optical absorption and scattering effects. We find that scattering and absorption play an important role in inactivation because the input irradiation is inherently scattered by the bacteria; therefore, the dose that bacteria feel is reduced. This scattering effect can be clearly shown by a technique that combines stained Escherichia coli and site selective irradiation obtained by a wavelength tunable pulsed laser. By measuring Live/Dead fluorescence microscopy images, we show that the inactivation attained by the transient photothermal heating is possible to instantaneously and selectively kill microorganisms such as Escherichia coli bacteria. Thus, this method is promising for the site selective inactivation of various pathogenic viruses and bacteria in a safe and simple manner.",19497057|28831133|28426435|5480400|33713893|29192556|12661961|32673522|32581288|32243946|17384309|31275622|19682340|25881030|25506761|26712541|33082410|6340727|31181447|21220143|19762061|18028277|33022467|27889622|24495489|27867713|25146226|21209706|24841116|32100390|18796633|32182409|17550590|21947414|10395466|28931903|30044862|16009720|29426899|22768792|16697377,,33082410|30097449|30954697|24495489|29959245

Germicidal ultraviolet light, typically at 254 nm, is effective in this context but, used directly, can be a health hazard to skin and eyes. By contrast, far-UVC light (207-222 nm) efficiently kills pathogens potentially without harm to exposed human tissues. We previously demonstrated that 222-nm far-UVC light efficiently kills airborne influenza virus and we extend those studies to explore far-UVC efficacy against airborne human coronaviruses alpha HCoV-229E and beta HCoV-OC43. Low doses of 1.7 and 1.2 mJ/cm2 inactivated 99.9% of aerosolized coronavirus 229E and OC43, respectively. As all human coronaviruses have similar genomic sizes, far-UVC light would be expected to show similar inactivation efficiency against other human coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2. Based on the beta-HCoV-OC43 results, continuous far-UVC exposure in occupied public locations at the current regulatory exposure limit (~3 mJ/cm2/hour) would result in ~90% viral inactivation in ~8 minutes, 95% in ~11 minutes, 99% in ~16 minutes and 99.9% inactivation in ~25 minutes. Thus while staying within current regulatory dose limits, low-dose-rate far-UVC exposure can potentially safely provide a major reduction in the ambient level of airborne coronaviruses in occupied public locations.",21994708|15257218|28225654|32083643|32222977|29073020|29466457|10872925|3786457|24146947|22458545|29101868|19439480|7644861|18848711|19009272|6066596|14801065|3791231|10168531|14866175|8341684|32182409|17822117|17205632|25720466|30044862|7271457|32243946|27275949|29426899,34799671|34785646|34778494|34769691|34712107|34703082|34673114|34662342|34659650|34645859|34620923|34603942|34577489|34535091|34521866|34495736|34480230|34465056|34404018|34372460|34315976|34282225|34226878|34226623|34221893|34206120|34183999|34157967|34150202|34102403|34049515|34031667|34029626|33967404|33967299|33917088|33907202|33846664|33841750|33832708|33799842|33785962|33759191|33749837|33714723|33706834|33669103|33658595|33655212|33643774|33500689|33467428|33465817|33462542|33456619|33384480|33380727|33374195|33349747|33330334|33294996|33273505|33263988|33184316|33154710|33083158|33050590|32976847|32911671|32896604,34668746|34495736|34620923|34404018|32763344|29426899|33022467|34452302

By contrast, we have previously shown that far-UVC light (207-222 nm) efficiently inactivates bacteria without harm to exposed mammalian skin. This is because, due to its strong absorbance in biological materials, far-UVC light cannot penetrate even the outer (non living) layers of human skin or eye; however, because bacteria and viruses are of micrometer or smaller dimensions, far-UVC can penetrate and inactivate them.

The observed action spectrum of B. subtilis spores deviated significantly from the relative absorbance spectrum of the DNA purified from the spores, but matched quite well with the relative absorbance spectrum of decoated spores. The action spectrum of B. subtilis spores determined in this study was statistically different from those reported in previous studies. On the other hand, the action spectrum of S. typhimurium bacteria matched quite well with the relative absorbance spectrum of DNA extracted from vegetative cells, except in the region below 240nm. It is concluded that the common use of the relative DNA absorbance spectrum as a surrogate for the germicidal action spectrum can result in systematic errors when evaluating the performance of a polychromatic UV light reactors using bioassays. For example, if the weighted germicidal fluence (UV dose) calculated using the relative DNA absorbance spectrum as the germicidal weighting factor is found to be 40mJcm(-2) for a medium pressure lamp UV reactor, that calculated using the relative action spectrum of B. subtilis spores, as determined in this study, would be 66mJcm(-2).",,34785646|34282225|33643774|31676798|31275622|31236005|27926432|26712541|25483976,20454780|16295846|17532124|19912558|18028363

Recent research has shown that polychromatic, medium-pressure (MP) UV sources are more effective than LP UV for disinfection of adenovirus when viral inactivation is measured using cell culture infectivity assays; however, UV-induced DNA damage may be repaired during cell culture infectivity assays, and this confounds interpretation of these results. Objectives of this work were to study adenoviral response to both LP and MP UV using (i) standard cell culture infectivity assays and (ii) a PCR assay to directly assess damage to the adenoviral genome without introducing the virus into cell culture. LP and MP UV dose response curves were determined for (i) log inactivation of the virus in cell culture and (ii) UV-induced lesions per kilobase of viral DNA as measured by the PCR assay. Results show that LP and MP UV are equally effective at damaging the genome; MP UV is more effective at inactivating adenovirus in cell culture. This work suggests that the higher disinfection efficacy of MP UV cannot be attributed to a difference in DNA damage induction.

In contrast, despite short wavelength-UVC light, especially 222-nm UVC, having been demonstrated to elicit a bactericidal effect, single irradiation with a high dose of 222-nm UVC energy has been reported to not induce mutagenic or cytotoxic DNA lesions in mammalian cells. However, the effect of chronic irradiation with a high dose of 222-nm UVC to mammalian cells has not been determined. In this study, it was demonstrated that large numbers of CPD-expressing cells were induced in the epidermis of mice following treatment with a small amount of single exposure 254-nm UVC, and then less than half of these cells reduced within 24 h. Chronic 254-nm UVC irradiation was revealed to induce sunburn and desquamation in mouse skin. Histological analysis demonstrated that small numbers of CPD-expressing cells were detected only in hyperkeratotic stratum corneum after chronic irradiation with a high dose of 254-nm UVC, and that significant hyperplasia and intercellular edema were also induced in the epidermis of mice. In contrast, chronic irradiation with 222-nm UVC light was revealed not to induce mutagenic or cytotoxic effects in the epidermis of mice. These results indicated that 222-nm UVC light emitted from the lamp apparatus (or device), which was designed to attenuate harmful light present in wavelengths of more than 230 nm, represents a promising tool for the reduction of SSI incidence in patients and hospital staff.",29466457|28225654|19686098|27275949|19022115|27611318|24146947|9284102|21804977|23519108|24527357|29426899|21209706|19135916|20111657|14866175|9699136|18419491|2857432|3344292|15748635|2029750|29101868|22564833|2990336|5640439|17768189,34785646|34734375|34495736|34452302|34404018|34282225|34226623|34029626|33669771|33643774|33590879|33480023|33465817|33353056|33294996|33192232|33082410|32911671|32896604|32812619|32785216|32581288|32551537|32490060|32222977|32033948,32785216|29101868|27275949|29464256|10493513

THE ABSORPTION OF ULTRA VIOLET LIGHT BY BACTERIA.,"Gates, F L FL",The Journal of general physiology,1930 Sep 20,"The simple conclusion of former investigators that the shorter the wave length of ultra violet light the greater the bactericidal action is in error. A study with measured monochromatic energy reveals a characteristic curve of bactericidal effectiveness with a striking maximum between 260 and 270 m.micro. The reciprocal of this abiotic energy curve suggests its close relation to specific light absorption by some single essential substance in the cell. Methods are described for determining the absorption curve, or absorption coefficients, of intact bacteria. These curves for S. aureus and B. coli have important points of similarity and of difference with the reciprocals of the curves of bactericidal incident energy, and point the way in a further search for the specific substance, or substances, involved in the lethal reaction.",19868187,33643774|32752793|31285811|31275622|27889622|27783061|20402193|2693973,19872522|19872521|19870002|19872826|19872838

The biophysical rationale is based on the limited penetration distance of 207-nm light in biological samples (e.g. stratum corneum) compared with that of 254-nm light. Here we extended our previous studies to 222-nm light and tested the hypothesis that there exists a narrow wavelength window in the far-UVC region, from around 200-222 nm, which is significantly harmful to bacteria, but without damaging cells in tissues. We used a krypton-chlorine (Kr-Cl) excimer lamp that produces 222-nm UV light with a bandpass filter to remove the lower- and higher-wavelength components. Relative to respective controls, we measured: 1. in vitro killing of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) as a function of UV fluence; 2. yields of the main UV-associated premutagenic DNA lesions (cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers and 6-4 photoproducts) in a 3D human skin tissue model in vitro; 3. eight cellular and molecular skin damage endpoints in exposed hairless mice in vivo. Comparisons were made with results from a conventional 254-nm UV germicidal lamp used as positive control. We found that 222-nm light kills MRSA efficiently but, unlike conventional germicidal UV lamps (254 nm), it produces almost no premutagenic UV-associated DNA lesions in a 3D human skin model and it is not cytotoxic to exposed mammalian skin. As predicted by biophysical considerations and in agreement with our previous findings, far-UVC light in the range of 200-222 nm kills bacteria efficiently regardless of their drug-resistant proficiency, but without the skin damaging effects associated with conventional germicidal UV exposure.",4085580|10734239|27275949|6195220|27816413|18979106|9866596|7071863|20402193|21904015|20851565|24146947|4028668|19075832|21804977|10023332|27742997|21812657|22962619|1828835|18424094|19296717|19135916|22731691|10653597|3399436|23668297|22226954|18348480|23577437|7678984|14866175|17932825|22523264|9699136|3389086|12091412|3671514|1894672|18947320|3786457|25814376|3791231|11964728|23889191|21315998|17768189|2626490|24060701,34734375|34603942|34495736|34480230|34465056|34404018|34307317|34282225|34150202|34031124|34029626|33643774|33590879|33480023|33465817|33353056|33294996|33192232|33184316|33026601|32911671|32896604|32837746|32812619|32785216|32768916|32637836|32581288|32551537|32222977|32033948|31915514|30610077|30096188|30044862|29466457|29426899,24146947|27275949|29101868|29466457|30096188

32911671,Control Measures for SARS-CoV-2: A Review on Light-Based Inactivation of Single-Stranded RNA Viruses.,"Hadi, Joshua J|Dunowska, Magdalena M|Wu, Shuyan S|Brightwell, Gale G","Pathogens (Basel, Switzerland)",2020 Sep 08,"SARS-CoV-2 is a single-stranded RNA virus classified in the family Coronaviridae. In this review, we summarize the literature on light-based (UV, blue, and red lights) sanitization methods for the inactivation of ssRNA viruses in different matrixes (air, liquid, and solid). The rate of inactivation of ssRNA viruses in liquid was higher than in air, whereas inactivation on solid surfaces varied with the type of surface. The efficacy of light-based inactivation was reduced by the presence of absorptive materials. Several technologies can be used to deliver light, including mercury lamp (conventional UV), excimer lamp (UV), pulsed-light, and light-emitting diode (LED). Pulsed-light technologies could inactivate viruses more quickly than conventional UV-C lamps. Large-scale use of germicidal LED is dependent on future improvements in their energy efficiency. Blue light possesses virucidal potential in the presence of exogenous photosensitizers, although femtosecond laser (ultrashort pulses) can be used to circumvent the need for photosensitizers. Red light can be combined with methylene blue for application in medical settings, especially for sanitization of blood products. Future modelling studies are required to establish clearer parameters for assessing susceptibility of viruses to light-based inactivation. There is considerable scope for improvement in the current germicidal light-based technologies and practices.",26085159|25681193|31759194|31792450|32242873|26818469|16386286|26117199|32275497|23224114|32311760|21994708|12690092|31811032|17898836|22542268|32470046|26500392|22590676|22226954|32568661|27697158|29878137|16415249|32603505|32150527|31696565|31978945|23335770|21104283|17542834|32392125|18460414|28290315|25527548|32300673|17530462|25954491|20719948|11487107|27805261|25105276|32284615|9066304|26712541|32155444|23075143|18522021|29144595|31133031|28046084|28225654|20976535|21450821|30106282|32340022|32329972|23526314|12690091|21145624|19406687|30789926|29491178|18348480|28064075|11773416|24146947|22458545|22846406|28888104|32107119|32179701|10933723|32004427|15122356|31996437|17108030|29350751|32741425|19296717|29986239|15831954|18597027|18848711|20861307|32421495|17041164|22803813|30893742|12388713|29732571|15168794|21524776|32201500|23056454|19095459|31434749|22905868|12405148|29239484|31522710|24495489|21130884|24960335|19457025|32165386|23581680|16254359|24266597|21806295|15144527|28040848|16710416|27889138|21356466|18522022|32265315|32240128|31316285|16099012|19430490|30947566|22582879|17247312|25379545|31930543|16081130|32329971|32123347|30546315|32290162|31986264|15345386|29456527|25928547|15356786|32301491|21676338|31397467|21859950|15128542|30391908|31654474|24060701|29195159|15631008|18245239|32221306|29345786|18792806|21779205|17692883|32673522|32387778|32182409|17550590|20030791|25101216|17822117|22913402|15350737|32581288|14631830|25066049|32159775|29793506|22416020|27759498|19089684|30044862|22832120|12757921|27557321|12514044|15530413|30166145|32225176|21183630|15819680|29426899|19801477|17474029|26945674,34799671|34729540|34593848|34549200|34536424|34465056|34452302|34444411|34315976|34226623|34149298|34029626|33918658|33872807|33807521|33670181|33658595|33655088,17474029|34495736|29959245|33133042|31930543|32355114

Ultraviolet (UV)-based technologies represent promising IPC tools: their effective application for sanitation has been extensively evaluated in the past but scant, heterogeneous and inconclusive evidence is available on their effect on SARS-CoV-2 transmission. With the aim of pooling the available evidence on the efficacy of UV technologies against coronaviruses, we conducted a systematic review following PRISMA guidelines, searching Medline, Embase and the Cochrane Library, and the main clinical trials' registries (WHO ICTRP, ClinicalTrials.gov, Cochrane and EU Clinical Trial Register). Quantitative data on studies' interventions were summarized in tables, pooled by different coronavirus species and strain, UV source, characteristics of UV light exposure and outcomes. Eighteen papers met our inclusion criteria, published between 1972 and 2020. Six focused on SARS-CoV-2, four on SARS-CoV-1, one on MERS-CoV, three on seasonal coronaviruses, and four on animal coronaviruses. All were experimental studies.

Far-UVC lighting is now being installed to directly irradiate spaces where humans are present, and it will be important to perform measurements to verify far-UVC lighting installations are operating within widely accepted exposure guidelines. In this work, we explore the use of a commercially available film, known as OrthoChromic OC-1, to measure ultraviolet radiation exposure. The film was tested with a variety of ultraviolet wavelengths and irradiance conditions, and the color change of the film was analyzed for increasing levels of radiant exposure. The film response extended over a dynamic range that was greater than the recommended exposure limits for far-UVC radiation so it can potentially be useful for health hazard monitoring. The spectrum of the incident ultraviolet radiation strongly affected the response of the film; therefore, for accurate measurements we recommend the measured spectrum match the spectrum used for calibration. Overall, dosimetry with this film provides a simple, accurate, and inexpensive method of quantifying ultraviolet radiation exposure that is suitable for far-UVC measurements.",29261289|32222977|29101868|29986239|30315076|29466457|11079695|32896604|32220842|29803456|25495690|26712541|15257218|28225654|32927421|28039742|17792965|25846917|32785216|30610077|18348480|24146947|22458545|19912558|31027771|28338819|28574149|32581288|32452563|32033948|17205632|30044862|32243946|30096188|27275949|17814296|29426899,,28338819|33471372|10943924|9639912|19259871

B, Biology",2018 Jan,"UVC radiation is known to be highly germicidal. However, exposure to 254-nm-UVC light causes DNA lesions such as cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPD) in human cells, and can induce skin cancer after long-term repeated exposures. It has been reported that short wavelength UVC is absorbed by proteins in the membrane and cytosol, and fails to reach the nucleus of human cells. Hence, irradiation with 222-nm UVC might be an optimum combination of effective disinfection and biological safety to human cells. In this study, the biological effectiveness of 222-nm UVC was investigated using a mouse model of a skin wound infected with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Irradiation with 222-nm UVC significantly reduced bacterial numbers on the skin surface compared with non-irradiated skin. Bacterial counts in wounds evaluated on days 3, 5, 8 and 12 after irradiation demonstrated that the bactericidal effect of 222-nm UVC was equal to or more effective than 254-nm UVC. Histological analysis revealed that migration of keratinocytes which is essential for the wound healing process was impaired in wounds irradiated with 254-nm UVC, but was unaffected in 222-nm UVC irradiated wounds. No CPD-expressing cells were detected in either epidermis or dermis of wounds irradiated with 222-nm UVC, whereas CPD-expressing cells were found in both epidermis and dermis irradiation with 254-nm UVC.

However, there has been no clear evidence for safety in chronic exposure to skin, particularly with respect to carcinogenesis. We therefore investigated the long-term effects of 222-nm UVC on skin using a highly photocarcinogenic phenotype mice that lack xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group A (Xpa-) gene, which is involved in repairing of CPDs. CPDs formation was recognized only uppermost layer of epidermis even with high dose of 222-nm UVC exposure. No tumors were observed in Xpa-knockout mice and wild-type mice by repetitive irradiation with 222-nm UVC, using a protocol which had shown to produce tumor in Xpa-knockout mice irradiated with broad-band UVB.

Spores and/or growing and stationary-phase cells of Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus thuringiensis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Clostridioides difficile and a herpesvirus were all killed or inactivated by UV222 and at lower fluences than with UV254 B. subtilis spores and cells lacking the major DNA repair protein RecA were more sensitive to UV222, as were spores lacking their DNA-protective proteins, the α/β-type small, acid-soluble spore proteins. The spore cores' large amount of Ca2+-dipicolinic acid (∼25% of the core dry weight) also protected B. subtilis and C. difficile spores against UV222, while spores' proteinaceous coat may have given some slight protection against UV222 Survivors among B. subtilis spores treated with UV222 acquired a large number of mutations, and this radiation generated known mutagenic photoproducts in spore and cell DNA, primarily cyclobutane-type pyrimidine dimers in growing cells and an α-thyminyl-thymine adduct termed the spore photoproduct (SP) in spores. Notably, the loss of a key SP repair protein markedly decreased spore UV222 resistance. UV222-treated B. subtilis spores germinated relatively normally, and the generation of colonies from these germinated spores was not salt sensitive. The latter two findings suggest that UV222 does not kill spores by general protein damage, and thus, the new results are consistent with the notion that DNA damage is responsible for the killing of spores and cells by UV222 IMPORTANCE Spores of a variety of bacteria are resistant to common decontamination agents, and many of them are major causes of food spoilage and some serious human diseases, including anthrax caused by spores of Bacillus anthracis Consequently, there is an ongoing need for efficient methods for spore eradication, in particular methods that have minimal deleterious effects on people or the environment.

Far-UVC technology is an emerging disinfection method that directly kills microorganisms using light. In contrast with conventional UV sterilization, far-UVC light has antimicrobial capabilities without apparent harm to mammalian cells. This study examines the application of 224 nm far-UVC light delivered from a laser using an optical diffuser towards the goal of protecting against bacterial invasion around skin penetrating devices. Delivery of far-UVC using a laser and optical fibers enables exposure to unique geometries that would otherwise be shielded when using a lamp. Testing of the bactericidal potential of diffusing the far-UVC laser output over a large area was tested and yielded qualitative area killing results. The killing of MRSA using this method was also examined using an in vitro survival assay. Results followed a classic log-linear disinfection model with a rate constant of k = 0.51 cm2/mJ, which corresponds to an inactivation cross section of D90 = 4.5 mJ/cm2. This study establishes far-UVC delivered from a laser through an optical diffuser as a viable solution for disinfection of susceptible regions such as around catheters, drivelines, or other skin penetrating medical devices.",28225654|27275949|23999949|24387497|25034793|9866596|24146947|24501765|22284381|19608582|7271457|28338819|22458545|7644861|22523264|22766022|17205632|23221186|29101868|23608003|28574149,34282225|33643774|33294996|32033948,28225654|29101868|22591268|28278065|26684367|32046660

21804977,UV wavelength-dependent DNA damage and human non-melanoma and melanoma skin cancer.,"Pfeifer, Gerd P GP|Besaratinia, Ahmad A",Photochemical & photobiological sciences : Official journal of the European Photochemistry Association and the European Society for Photobiology,2012 Jan,"Ultraviolet (UV) irradiation from the sun has been epidemiologically and mechanistically linked to skin cancer, a spectrum of diseases of rising incidence in many human populations. Both non-melanoma and melanoma skin cancers are associated with sunlight exposure. In this review, we discuss the UV wavelength-dependent formation of the major UV-induced DNA damage products, their repair and mutagenicity and their potential involvement in sunlight-associated skin cancers. We emphasize the major role played by the cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) in skin cancer mutations relative to that of (6-4) photoproducts and oxidative DNA damage. Collectively, the data implicate the CPD as the DNA lesion most strongly involved in human cancers induced by sunlight.",7690474|12771205|18319329|12398891|9139896|9066291|9450485|8176018|12789287|17131335|8599951|17295241|17344846|11572873|9974380|9163689|3664636|12239425|21083380|19367127|8972202|9354431|8657563|20955242|16963272|1996338|1946433|7651729|10709358|8422356|16570852|21436607|8248141|10898585|7927872|15374941|19822754|10219070|8128225|9066304|11312434|18356809|18845270|18326785|20016485|8483937|12525487|2672059|12885257|12888515|18348450|9111219|16009942|2089431|9426187|1549126|2185842|12760530|15041750|10835277|8389052|16429450|11024179|21159145|19582264|15748634|16462187|4530308|9463848|15590329|20439744|9813119|21499247|20707934|3054882|12619107|15748635|7987388|10711242|16866379|16374481|16954188|21494240|10398605|21540015|19186150|10385124|18421705|16845408|17389394|8341684|10907520|8416751|7731703|12086670|10461463|21160086|20128873|20237685|15491641|21613571|10543945|10365447|2087500|9288772|15209513,34734375|34589668|34465056|34436289|34371586|34330711|33928184|33917793|33850479|33849058|33552830|33537393|33465817|33432511|33247699|33207206|32998469|32962063|32812619|32785216|32765487|32737342|32724423|32664608|32532056|32441029|32434987|32222977|32188867|32124989|32121576|31973093|31956441|31636809|31568659|31142321|31051015|31009466|30962436|30783928|30761684|30674003|30487387|30452757|30118999|30044862|29904586|29760754|29476131|29466611|29101868|28904394|28791065|28676457|28582771|28554325|28525579|28455491|28338819|28334906|28301513|28293423|28225654|27818081|27791197|27788131|27689081|27611318|27470212|27275949|27119462|27098927|27036006|26953144|26681797|26511842|26445994|26287245|26256790|26075084|26001532|25999502|25897114|25617667|25402978|25354245|25346791|24867336|24844860|24662766|24594668|24549972|24494039|24270004|24148148|24146947|24086153|23861464|23650282|23616051|23523584|23344664|23050963|22735701|22623796,26263704|30586386|15748635|25700512|10711242

UVC irradiation of high energy and short wavelengths, especially in the 200-290-nm range possesses the great potential for germicidal disinfection. These properties of UVC allow to damage or destruct the nucleic acids (DNA/RNA) in diverse microbes (e.g., bacteria, fungi, and viruses). UVC light can hence be used as a promising tool for prevention and control of their infection or transmission. The present review offers insights into the historical perspective, mode of action, and recent advancements in the application of UVC-based antiviral therapy against coronaviruses (including SARS CoV-2). Moreover, the application of UVC lights in the sanitization of healthcare units, public places, medical instruments, respirators, and personal protective equipment (PPE) is also discussed.

MRSA bacteria in different concentrations on blood agar plates were inactivated with irradiation doses in the range of 15-40 mJ/cm2.

19912558,"Comparison of the disinfection effects of vacuum-UV (VUV) and UV light on Bacillus subtilis spores in aqueous suspensions at 172, 222 and 254 nm.","Wang, Ding D|Oppenländer, Thomas T|El-Din, Mohamed Gamal MG|Bolton, James R JR",Photochemistry and photobiology,2010 Jan-Feb,"The efficacy of UV and vacuum-UV (VUV) disinfection of Bacillus subtilis spores in aqueous suspensions at wavelengths of 172, 222 and 254 nm was evaluated. A Xe(2)* excilamp, a KrCl* excilamp and a low-pressure mercury lamp were used as almost monochromatic light sources at these three wavelengths. The first-order inactivation rate constants at 172, 222 and 254 nm were 0.0023, 0.122 and 0.069 cm(2) mJ(-1), respectively. Therefore, a 2 log reduction of B. subtilis spores was reached with fluences (UV doses) of 870, 21.6 and 40.4 mJ cm(-2) at these individual wavelengths. Consequently, for the inactivation of B. subtilis spores, VUV exposure at 172 nm is much less efficient than exposure at the other two wavelengths, while exposure at 222 nm is more efficient than that at 254 nm, which is probably because triplet energy transfer from DPA to thymine bases at 222 nm is higher than that at 254 nm. This research indicated quantitatively that VUV light is not practicable for microorganism disinfection in water and wastewater treatment. However, in comparison with other advanced oxidation processes (e.g. UV/TiO(2), UV/H(2)O(2) or O(3)/H(2)O(2)) the VUV-initiated photolysis of water is likely more efficient in generating hydroxyl radicals and more effective for the inactivation of microorganisms.",,34734375|34128162|33643774|33467428|33465817|33294996|33026601|32222977|32220842|32046660|32033948|31236005|30610077|30315076|29426899|28496972|27934804|24146947,17532124|19505708|19120918|21126749|19818467

To estimate an acceptable safety dose for human skin in the UV-C range, especially short UV-C, we studied the biological effects of 207, 222 and 235 nm UV-C using albino hairless mice and evaluated the inflammatory reactions in the skin. To explore an appropriate indicator to evaluate the biological response, we employed determination of the minimal perceptible response dose (MPRD), by which any subtle cutaneous response; erythema, edema and scale could be observed by visual inspection. Erythema was rarely observed, but edema and scale formation were evident for short UV-C wavelengths. The MPRD at 207, 222 and 235 nm was determined to be > 15, 15 and 2.0 kJ m-2 , respectively.

16386286,"Inactivation credit of UV radiation for viruses, bacteria and protozoan (oo)cysts in water: a review.","Hijnen, W A M WA|Beerendonk, E F EF|Medema, G J GJ",Water research,2006 Jan,"UV disinfection technology is of growing interest in the water industry since it was demonstrated that UV radiation is very effective against (oo)cysts of Cryptosporidium and Giardia, two pathogenic micro-organisms of major importance for the safety of drinking water. Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment, the new concept for microbial safety of drinking water and wastewater, requires quantitative data of the inactivation or removal of pathogenic micro-organisms by water treatment processes. The objective of this study was to review the literature on UV disinfection and extract quantitative information about the relation between the inactivation of micro-organisms and the applied UV fluence. The quality of the available studies was evaluated and only high-quality studies were incorporated in the analysis of the inactivation kinetics. The results show that UV is effective against all waterborne pathogens. The inactivation of micro-organisms by UV could be described with first-order kinetics using fluence-inactivation data from laboratory studies in collimated beam tests. No inactivation at low fluences (offset) and/or no further increase of inactivation at higher fluences (tailing) was observed for some micro-organisms. Where observed, these were included in the description of the inactivation kinetics, even though the cause of tailing is still a matter of debate. The parameters that were used to describe inactivation are the inactivation rate constant k (cm(2)/mJ), the maximum inactivation demonstrated and (only for bacterial spores and Acanthamoeba) the offset value. These parameters were the basis for the calculation of the microbial inactivation credit (MIC=""log-credits"") that can be assigned to a certain UV fluence. The most UV-resistant organisms are viruses, specifically Adenoviruses, and bacterial spores. The protozoon Acanthamoeba is also highly UV resistant. Bacteria and (oo)cysts of Cryptosporidium and Giardia are more susceptible with a fluence requirement of <20 mJ/cm(2) for an MIC of 3 log. Several studies have reported an increased UV resistance of environmental bacteria and bacterial spores, compared to lab-grown strains. This means that higher UV fluences are required to obtain the same level of inactivation. Hence, for bacteria and spores, a correction factor of 2 and 4 was included in the MIC calculation, respectively, whereas some wastewater studies suggest that a correction of a factor of 7 is needed under these conditions. For phages and viruses this phenomenon appears to be of little significance and for protozoan (oo)cysts this aspect needs further investigation. Correction of the required fluence for DNA repair is considered unnecessary under the conditions of drinking water practice (no photo-repair, dark repair insignificant, esp. at higher (60 mJ/cm(2)) fluences) and probably also wastewater practice (photo-repair limited by light absorption). To enable accurate assessment of the effective fluence in continuous flow UV systems in water treatment practice, biodosimetry is still essential, although the use of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) improves the description of reactor hydraulics and fluence distribution. For UV systems that are primarily dedicated to inactivate the more sensitive pathogens (Cryptosporidium, Giardia, pathogenic bacteria), additional model organisms are needed to serve as biodosimeter.",,34804602|34777529|34683555|34465056|34315976|34282225|34202557|34010719|33920777|33909651|33817615|33776550|33669103|33654547|33573357|33527549|33482030|33472364|33374200|33330334|33322250|33268203|33091804|33015361|32923046|32921917|32914124|32911671|32895629|32812619|32802567|32750327|32711201|32640736|32625713|32417460|32313514|32288664|32148829|31753544|31697778|31684172|31684085|31608267|31578217|31481620|31403004|31275622|31214129|31193445|31083664|30848516|30825294|30789926|30746625|30690218|30551597|30487383|30333051|30315076|30152866|30047962|30032343|30012989|29976878|29959245|29755205|29707663|29679283|29546616|29535972|29515853|29307073|29225923|29184541|29109412|28831133|28744569|28670307|28616834|28560163|28429732|28399166|28283956|28039137|27926432|27889622|27796997|27783334|27736884|27655528|27525474|27421857|27379301|27335858|26975046|26893536|26842766|26712541|26564479|26539493|26497451|26355273|26253683|26171968|26140674|25698384|25541706|25528135|25399400|25213288|25106777|24952878|24452745|24276023|24217177|24141130|23724332|23686270|23487495|23423870|23396332|23392903|23204362|23171372|23133525|23079692|22961900|22856652|22829792|22660714|22327583|22156429|21720867|21136919|20948930|20543052|19860917|19365668|19333622|19205767|19074604|18830402|18507911|18424543|18259813|18160141|18029197|17574996|17413061|17041164|17012589|16960772,15567586|17040222|19892384|19505708|18996557

Growth inhibition resulted from 254-UVC or 222-UVC exposure depending on the dose of UVC radiation. However, with respect to the phenotype of 222-UVC-irradiated plants, the leaves curled under 1 kJ m-2 and were markedly bleached under 10 kJ m-2 compared with those of plants irradiated with 254-UVC. The cellular state, especially the mitochondrial dynamics, of epidermal and mesophyll cells of Arabidopsis leaves exposed to 254-UVC or 222-UVC radiation was investigated using Arabidopsis plants expressing mitochondrial matrix-targeted yellow fluorescent protein (MT-YFP) under the control of Pro35S to visualize the mitochondria. 222-UVC (1 or 5 kJ m-2) severely damaged the guard cells within the epidermis, and YFP signals and chloroplast autofluorescence in guard cells within the epidermis exposed to 222-UVC (1 or 5 kJ m-2) were not detected compared with those in cells exposed to 254-UVC radiation. In addition, 222-UVC irradiation led to mitochondrial fragmentation in mesophyll cells, similar to the effects of 254-UVC exposure. These results suggest that 222-UVC severely damages guard cells and epidermal cells and that such damage might have resulted in growth inhibition.",16024598|19120918|28225654|32222977|19912558|28123106|3344292|32243946|17687389|21804977|33082410|23668297|24146947|24471507|30265926|20629801|17205632|30044862|30481398|27275949|33237047|29426899,,32222977|19590985|29608029|3598201|30044862
30610077,Increased Resistance of Salmonella enterica Serovar Typhimurium and Escherichia coli O157:H7 to 222-Nanometer Krypton-Chlorine Excilamp Treatment by Acid Adaptation.,"Kang, Jun-Won JW|Kang, Dong-Hyun DH",Applied and environmental microbiology,2019 03 15,"In this study, we examined the change in resistance of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium and Escherichia coli O157:H7 to 222-nm krypton-chlorine (KrCl) excilamp treatment as influenced by acid adaptation and identified a mechanism of resistance change. In addition, we measured changes in apple juice quality indicators, such as color, total phenols, and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical scavenging activity, during treatment. Non-acid-adapted and acid-adapted pathogens were induced by growing the cells in tryptic soy broth without dextrose (TSB w/o D) at pH 7.3 and in TSB w/o D at pH 5.0 (adjusted with HCl), respectively. For the KrCl excilamp treatment, acid-adapted pathogens exhibited significantly (P < 0.05) higher D5d values, which indicate dosages required to achieve a 5-log reduction, than those for non-acid-adapted pathogens in both commercially clarified apple juice and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and the pathogens in the juice showed significantly (P < 0.05) higher D5d values than those for pathogens in PBS because of the UV-absorbing characteristics of apple juice. Through mechanism identification, it was found that the generation of lipid peroxidation in the cell membrane, inducing cell membrane destruction, was significantly (P < 0.05) lower in acid-adapted cells than in non-acid-adapted cells for the same amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated at the same dose because the ratio of unsaturated to saturated fatty acids (USFA/SFA) in the cell membrane was significantly (P < 0.05) decreased as a result of acid adaptation. Treated apple juice showed no significant (P > 0.05) difference in quality indicators compared to those of untreated controls during treatment at 1,773 mJ/cm2 IMPORTANCE There is a need for novel, mercury-free UV lamp technology to replace germicidal lamps containing harmful mercury, which are routinely utilized for UV pasteurization of apple juice. In addition, consideration of the changes in response to antimicrobial treatments that may occur when pathogens are adapted to the acid in an apple juice matrix is critical to the practical application of this technology. Based on this, an investigation using 222-nm KrCl excilamp technology, an attractive alternative to mercury lamps, was conducted. Our study demonstrated increased resistance to 222-nm KrCl excilamp treatment as pathogens adapted to acids, and this was due to changes in reactivity to ROS with changes in the fatty acid composition of the cell membrane. Despite increased resistance, the 222-nm KrCl excilamp achieved pathogen reductions of 5 log or more at laboratory scale without affecting apple juice quality. These results provide valuable baseline data for application of 222-nm KrCl excilamps in the apple juice industry.",9708273|26385989|12732538|14766573|23995939|9358240|20629801|29803456|15576803|10791743|24238364|17720838|22827549|24368153|10838073|29355961|19863382|21199923|15893399|10877775|15854705|10049198|23738945|8418063|10388702|28225654|18313782|9926995|11930951|25475303|28039742|11252473|24146947|16298302|26179637|12127492|7497639|20802077|10411742|21802974|8965797|23399076|27889622|24862270|1938893|16305669|25285481|8323025|15466551|19912558|23956394|10989603|26042117|8795195|12125377|11718765|25346257|16569070|6833274|11437344|19021811|15217160|15690803|8899990|27275949|22784863|23522904|22027063|26033289,33990307|33805200|33643774|33294996|32220842,32497789|32220842|30315076|30952663|31027771
34452302,Virucidal Efficacy of Blue LED and Far-UVC Light Disinfection against Feline Infectious Peritonitis Virus as a Model for SARS-CoV-2.,"Gardner, Amanda A|Ghosh, Sayani S|Dunowska, Magdalena M|Brightwell, Gale G",Viruses,2021 07 23,"Transmission of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) occurs through respiratory droplets passed directly from person to person or indirectly through fomites, such as common use surfaces or objects. The aim of this study was to determine the virucidal efficacy of blue LED (405 nm) and far-UVC (222 nm) light in comparison to standard UVC (254 nm) irradiation for the inactivation of feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) on different matrices as a model for SARS-CoV-2. Wet or dried FIPV on stainless steel, plastic, or paper discs, in the presence or absence of artificial saliva, were exposed to various wavelengths of light for different time periods (1-90 min). Dual activity of blue LED and far-UVC lights were virucidal for most wet and dried FIPV within 4 to 16 min on all matrices. Individual action of blue LED and far-UVC lights were virucidal for wet FIPV but required longer irradiation times (8-90 min) to reach a 4-log reduction. In comparison, LED (265 nm) and germicidal UVC (254 nm) were virucidal on almost all matrices for both wet and dried FIPV within 1 min exposure. UVC was more effective for the disinfection of surfaces as compared to blue LED and far-UVC individually or together. However, dual action of blue LED and far-UVC was virucidal. This combination of lights could be used as a safer alternative to traditional UVC.",30047962|25271615|23075143|17002634|22846406|14907727|32579874|32123347|27794248|3786457|31986261|32015507|28900751|32275497|12690092|31811032|12958366|31978945|33777655|33746482|32432672|32530505|9343491|28029378|6687886|28064075|12690091|22458545|33510320|24021819|24837550|15122356|31554297|28040848|3416941|31986264|33070960|32301491|21676338|28384506|26277478|34118297|32182409|11023724|19254859|14631830|32911671|15350737|32159775|30044862|32243946|32910955,,33807470|34495736|33484873|32896604|33807521|32581288
