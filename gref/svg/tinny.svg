Postexposure recovery of threshold sensitivity has been assumed to indicate reversal of damage to delicate mechano&#45;sensory and neural structures of the inner ear and no persistent or delayed consequences for auditory function. Here, we show, using cochlear functional assays and confocal imaging of the inner ear in mouse, that acoustic overexposures causing moderate, but completely reversible, threshold elevation leave cochlear sensory cells intact, but cause acute loss of afferent nerve terminals and delayed degeneration of the cochlear nerve. Results suggest that noise&#45;induced damage to the ear has progressive consequences that are considerably more widespread than are revealed by conventional threshold testing. This primary neurodegeneration should add to difficulties hearing in noisy environments, and could contribute to tinnitus, hyperacusis, and other perceptual anomalies commonly associated with inner ear damage.&#10;~&#10;PMID: 19906956&#10;Journal: The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience" target="_blank">

SSNHL is most commonly defined as sensorineural hearing loss of 30 dB or greater over at least three contiguous audiometric frequencies occurring within a 72&#45;hr period. Although the differential for SSNHL is vast, for the majority of patients an etiologic factor is not identified. Treatment for SSNHL of known etiology is directed toward that agent, with poor hearing outcomes characteristic for discoverable etiologies that cause inner ear hair cell loss. Steroid therapy is the current mainstay of treatment of idiopathic SSNHL in the United States. The prognosis for hearing recovery for idiopathic SSNHL is dependent on a number of factors including the severity of hearing loss, age, presence of vertigo, and shape of the audiogram.&#10;~&#10;PMID: 21606048&#10;Journal: Trends in amplification" target="_blank">

Traditional theories assume that tinnitus is triggered by cochlear damage, but many tinnitus patients present with a normal audiogram, i.e., with no direct signs of cochlear damage. Here, we report that in human subjects with tinnitus and a normal audiogram, auditory brainstem responses show a significantly reduced amplitude of the wave I potential (generated by primary auditory nerve fibers) but normal amplitudes of the more centrally generated wave V. This provides direct physiological evidence of &#39;hidden hearing loss&#39; that manifests as reduced neural output from the cochlea, and consequent renormalization of neuronal response magnitude within the brainstem. Employing an established computational model, we demonstrate how tinnitus could arise from a homeostatic response of neurons in the central auditory system to reduced auditory nerve input in the absence of elevated hearing thresholds.&#10;~&#10;PMID: 21940438&#10;Journal: The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience" target="_blank">

Here, auditory nerve and brainstem function in response to sound was assessed via auditory brainstem responses (ABR) in humans with tinnitus and without. Tinnitus subjects showed reduced wave I amplitude (indicating reduced auditory nerve activity) but enhanced wave V (reflecting elevated input to the inferior colliculi) compared with non&#45;tinnitus subjects matched in age, sex, and pure&#45;tone threshold. The transformation from reduced peripheral activity to central hyperactivity in the tinnitus group was especially apparent in the V/I and III/I amplitude ratios. Compared with a third cohort of younger, non&#45;tinnitus subjects, both tinnitus, and matched, non&#45;tinnitus groups showed elevated thresholds above 4 kHz and reduced wave I amplitude, indicating that the differences between tinnitus and matched non&#45;tinnitus subjects occurred against a backdrop of shared peripheral dysfunction that, while not tinnitus specific, cannot be discounted as a factor in tinnitus development. Animal lesion and human neuroanatomical data combine to indicate that waves III and V in humans reflect activity in a pathway originating in the ventral cochlear nucleus (VCN) and with spherical bushy cells (SBC) in particular. We conclude that the elevated III/I and V/I amplitude ratios in tinnitus subjects reflect disproportionately high activity in the SBC pathway for a given amount of peripheral input. The results imply a role for the VCN in tinnitus and suggest the SBC pathway as a target for tinnitus treatment.&#10;~&#10;PMID: 22869301&#10;Journal: Journal of the Association for Research in Otolaryngology : JARO" target="_blank">

The experimental group comprised 17 subjects with tinnitus, while the control group consisted of age&#45; and sex&#45;matched subjects, not suffering from tinnitus. The aim of the study was to determine whether extended HF audiometry or ABR might reveal significant differences between these two groups of subjects with normal hearing sensitivity. In addition, the characteristics of tinnitus in subjects with normal audiograms were discussed. The results of extended HF audiometry showed no significant differences between the subjects with and without tinnitus. The ABR parameters considered were also within normal limits bilaterally. Based on the methods employed in this study, tinnitus in normal listeners does not appear to reflect appreciable damage in the cochlea or in the brain&#45;stem auditory pathways.

To address this nominal paradox, we recorded responses from single auditory nerve fibers in guinea pigs exposed to this type of neuropathic noise (4&#45; to 8&#45;kHz octave band at 106 dB SPL for 2 h). Two weeks postexposure, ABR thresholds had recovered to normal, while suprathreshold ABR amplitudes were reduced. Both thresholds and amplitudes of distortion&#45;product otoacoustic emissions fully recovered, suggesting recovery of hair cell function. Loss of up to 30% of auditory&#45;nerve synapses on inner hair cells was confirmed by confocal analysis of the cochlear sensory epithelium immunostained for pre&#45; and postsynaptic markers. In single fiber recordings, at 2 wk postexposure, frequency tuning, dynamic range, postonset adaptation, first&#45;spike latency and its variance, and other basic properties of auditory nerve response were all completely normal in the remaining fibers. The only physiological abnormality was a change in population statistics suggesting a selective loss of fibers with low&#45; and medium&#45;spontaneous rates. Selective loss of these high&#45;threshold fibers would explain how ABR thresholds can recover despite such significant noise&#45;induced neuropathy. A selective loss of high&#45;threshold fibers may contribute to the problems of hearing in noisy environments that characterize the aging auditory system.&#10;~&#10;PMID: 23596328&#10;Journal: Journal of neurophysiology" target="_blank">

Although such exposure can also result in permanent threshold elevation, some individuals with noise&#45;induced hyperacusis or tinnitus show clinically normal thresholds. Recent work in animals has shown that a &#39;neuropathic&#39; noise exposure can cause immediate, permanent degeneration of the cochlear nerve despite complete threshold recovery and lack of hair cell damage (Kujawa SG, Liberman MC. J Neurosci 29: 14077&#45;14085, 2009; Lin HW, Furman AC, Kujawa SG, Liberman MC. J Assoc Res Otolaryngol 12: 605&#45;616, 2011). Here we ask whether this noise&#45;induced primary neuronal degeneration results in abnormal auditory behavior, based on the acoustic startle response (ASR) and prepulse inhibition (PPI) of startle. Responses were measured in mice exposed either to a &#39;neuropathic&#39; noise or to a lower&#45;intensity, &#39;nonneuropathic&#39; noise and in unexposed control mice. Mice with cochlear neuropathy displayed hyperresponsivity to sound, evidenced by enhanced ASR and PPI, while exposed mice without neuronal loss showed control&#45;like responses. Gap PPI tests, often used to assess tinnitus, revealed limited gap detection deficits in mice with cochlear neuropathy only for certain gap&#45;startle latencies, inconsistent with the presence of tinnitus &#39;filling in the gap.&#39; Despite significantly reduced wave 1 of the auditory brainstem response, representing cochlear nerve activity, later peaks were unchanged or enhanced, suggesting compensatory neural hyperactivity in the auditory brainstem. Considering the rapid postexposure onset of both cochlear neuropathy and exaggerated startle&#45;based behavior, the results suggest a role for cochlear primary neuronal degeneration, per se, in the central neural excitability that could underlie the generation of hyperacusis.&#10;~&#10;PMID: 24198321&#10;Journal: Journal of neurophysiology" target="_blank">

Our recent work in mouse and guinea pig has challenged that view. In noise&#45;induced hearing loss, exposures causing only reversible threshold shifts (and no hair cell loss) nevertheless cause permanent loss of &gt;50% of cochlear&#45;nerve/hair&#45;cell synapses. Similarly, in age&#45;related hearing loss, degeneration of cochlear synapses precedes both hair cell loss and threshold elevation. This primary neural degeneration has remained hidden for three reasons: 1) the spiral ganglion cells, the cochlear neural elements commonly assessed in studies of SNHL, survive for years despite loss of synaptic connection with hair cells, 2) the synaptic terminals of cochlear nerve fibers are unmyelinated and difficult to see in the light microscope, and 3) the degeneration is selective for cochlear&#45;nerve fibers with high thresholds. Although not required for threshold detection in quiet (e.g. threshold audiometry or auditory brainstem response threshold), these high&#45;threshold fibers are critical for hearing in noisy environments. Our research suggests that 1) primary neural degeneration is an important contributor to the perceptual handicap in SNHL, and 2) in cases where the hair cells survive, neurotrophin therapies can elicit neurite outgrowth from spiral ganglion neurons and re&#45;establishment of their peripheral synapses.

Such noise exposure destroys synaptic connections between cochlear hair cells and auditory nerve fibers; however, there is no clinical test of this synaptopathy in humans. In animals, synaptopathy reduces the amplitude of auditory brainstem response (ABR) wave&#45;I. Unfortunately, ABR wave&#45;I is difficult to measure in humans, limiting its clinical use. Here, using analogous measurements in humans and mice, we show that the effect of masking noise on the latency of the more robust ABR wave&#45;V mirrors changes in ABR wave&#45;I amplitude. Furthermore, in our human cohort, the effect of noise on wave&#45;V latency predicts perceptual temporal sensitivity. Our results suggest that measures of the effects of noise on ABR wave&#45;V latency can be used to diagnose cochlear synaptopathy in humans.&#10;~&#10;PMID: 27030760&#10;Journal: The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience" target="_blank">

In these animal models, the disorder is characterized by a reduction in amplitude of wave I of the auditory brainstem response (ABR) to high&#45;level stimuli, whereas the response at threshold is unaffected. The aim of the present study was to determine if this disorder is prevalent in young adult humans with normal audiometric hearing. One hundred and twenty six participants (75 females) aged 18&#45;36 were tested. Participants had a wide range of lifetime noise exposures as estimated by a structured interview. Audiometric thresholds did not differ across noise exposures up to 8 kHz, although 16&#45;kHz audiometric thresholds were elevated with increasing noise exposure for females but not for males. ABRs were measured in response to high&#45;pass (1.5 kHz) filtered clicks of 80 and 100 dB peSPL. Frequency&#45;following responses (FFRs) were measured to 80 dB SPL pure tones from 240 to 285 Hz, and to 80 dB SPL 4 kHz pure tones amplitude modulated at frequencies from 240 to 285 Hz (transposed tones). The bandwidth of the ABR stimuli and the carrier frequency of the transposed tones were chosen to target the 3&#45;6 kHz characteristic frequency region which is usually associated with noise damage in humans. The results indicate no relation between noise exposure and the amplitude of the ABR. In particular, wave I of the ABR did not decrease with increasing noise exposure as predicted. ABR wave V latency increased with increasing noise exposure for the 80 dB peSPL click. High carrier&#45;frequency (envelope) FFR signal&#45;to&#45;noise ratios decreased as a function of noise exposure in males but not females. However, these correlations were not significant after the effects of age were controlled. The results suggest either that noise&#45;induced cochlear synaptopathy is not a significant problem in young, audiometrically normal adults, or that the ABR and FFR are relatively insensitive to this disorder in young humans, although it is possible that the effects become more pronounced with age.&#10;~&#10;PMID: 27816499&#10;Journal: Hearing research" target="_blank">

The neural abnormalities underlying tinnitus are largely unknown. This study analysis the auditory brainstem responses in normal hearing patients with tinnitus. This study consisted of 100 patients divided into two groups. Group I (Control): 50 Normal hearing patients without tinnitus. Group II (Study): 50 Normal hearing patients complaining of tinnitus. Both groups were submitted to full audiological history taking, otological examination, basic audiologic evaluation and Auditory brainstem responses (ABR) followed by calculation of the absolute latencies of wave I, III and V and interpeak latencies between waves I&#45;III, III&#45;V and I&#45;V. In the study group 20 patients showed abnormal results in at least 1 of the 6 parameters evaluated. The results of absolute latencies of wave I, III and V showed significant prolongation, but the interpeak latencies of waves I&#45;III, III&#45;V and I&#45;V were not significantly prolonged when compared with control group. Our study data showed that there are changes in the central pathways in the study group. The significance of these changes must be investigated with further audiological and neurological tests. We also understand that ABR has to be included in the work up of tinnitus patients whose hearing is within normal parameters.&#10;~&#10;PMID: 27833867&#10;Journal: Indian journal of otolaryngology and head and neck surgery : official publication of the Association of Otolaryngologists of India" target="_blank">

The pathophysiology and exact generation site of tinnitus is not precisely established. Auditory brainstem response (ABR) and late latency response (LLR) findings in individuals with tinnitus show mixed results in the literature. Majority of studies have focused on individuals having tinnitus with peripheral hearing loss. The present study explores ABR and LLR characteristics among tinnitus patients with normal audiometric presentation; with no direct indication of any cochlear lesion. This study aims at characterizing the ABR and LLR findings in individuals with tinnitus having normal audiometric presentation. ABR and LLR waveform characteristics were recorded and compared between participants with tinnitus (Group 1) and those without tinnitus (Group 2). The ABR analysis indicated no significant differences in latency and amplitude between Groups 1 and 2. However, patients with tinnitus showed abnormally reduced absolute amplitudes of peaks I and V. LLR analysis indicated no significant differences in latency and amplitude between Groups 1 and 2 except enhanced amplitude of P1. The reduced amplitude of peaks I and V along with normal absolute latencies of peaks I, III and V indicate that the origin of tinnitus is possibly due to reduced excitation of auditory nerve fibres arising from a peripheral hearing loss beyond 8 kHz. The P1 amplitude enhancement could be attributed to mechanism explaining central gain model; which suggests that central auditory structures recalibrates the mean firing rate, considering the reduced output from sensory structures, generating neural noise perceived as tinnitus.&#10;~&#10;PMID: 27904821&#10;Journal: Intractable &amp; rare diseases research" target="_blank">

Such &#39;cochlear synaptopathy&#39; is associated with amplitude reductions in wave I of the auditory brainstem response (ABR) at moderate&#45;to&#45;high sound levels. Similar ABR results have been reported in humans with tinnitus and normal audiometric thresholds, leading to the suggestion that tinnitus in these cases might be a consequence of synaptopathy. However, the ABR is an indirect measure of synaptopathy and it is unclear whether the results in humans reflect the same mechanisms demonstrated in rodents. Measures of noise exposure were not obtained in the human studies, and high frequency audiometric loss may have impacted ABR amplitudes. To clarify the role of cochlear synaptopathy in tinnitus with a normal audiogram, we recorded ABRs, envelope following responses (EFRs), and noise exposure histories in young adults with tinnitus and matched controls. Tinnitus was associated with significantly greater lifetime noise exposure, despite close matching for age, sex, and audiometric thresholds up to 14 kHz. However, tinnitus was not associated with reduced ABR wave I amplitude, nor with significant effects on EFR measures of synaptopathy. These electrophysiological measures were also uncorrelated with lifetime noise exposure, providing no evidence of noise&#45;induced synaptopathy in this cohort, despite a wide range of exposures. In young adults with normal audiograms, tinnitus may be related not to cochlear synaptopathy but to other effects of noise exposure.&#10;~&#10;PMID: 27964937&#10;Journal: Hearing research" target="_blank">

For example, moderate noise exposure in mice can destroy up to ∼50% of synapses between auditory nerve fibers (ANFs) and inner hair cells (IHCs) without affecting outer hair cells (OHCs) or thresholds, because the synaptopathy occurs first in high&#45;threshold ANFs. However, the fiber loss likely impairs temporal processing and hearing&#45;in&#45;noise, a classic complaint of those with sensorineural hearing loss. Non&#45;human primates appear to be less vulnerable to noise&#45;induced hair&#45;cell loss than rodents, but their susceptibility to synaptopathy has not been studied. Because establishing a non&#45;human primate model may be important in the development of diagnostics and therapeutics, we examined cochlear innervation and the damaging effects of acoustic overexposure in young adult rhesus macaques. Anesthetized animals were exposed bilaterally to narrow&#45;band noise centered at 2 kHz at various sound&#45;pressure levels for 4 h. Cochlear function was assayed for up to 8 weeks following exposure via auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) and otoacoustic emissions (OAEs). A moderate loss of synaptic connections (mean of 12&#45;27% in the basal half of the cochlea) followed temporary threshold shifts (TTS), despite minimal hair&#45;cell loss. A dramatic loss of synapses (mean of 50&#45;75% in the basal half of the cochlea) was seen on IHCs surviving noise exposures that produced permanent threshold shifts (PTS) and widespread hair&#45;cell loss. Higher noise levels were required to produce PTS in macaques compared to rodents, suggesting that primates are less vulnerable to hair&#45;cell loss. However, the phenomenon of noise&#45;induced cochlear synaptopathy in primates is similar to that seen in rodents.&#10;~&#10;PMID: 28712672&#10;Journal: Hearing research" target="_blank">

Despite this effort, the use of the ABR for tinnitus diagnosis or as an outcome measure is under debate. The present study reviewed published literature on ABR and tinnitus. The authors searched PubMed, MedLine, Embase, PsycINFO, and CINAHL, and identified additional records through manually searching reference lists and gray literature. There were 4,566 articles identified through database searching and 151 additional studies through the manual search (4,717 total): 2,128 articles were removed as duplicates, and 2,567 records did not meet eligibility criteria. From the final 22 articles that were included, ABR results from 1,240 tinnitus subjects and 664 control subjects were compiled and summarized with a focus on three main areas: the participant characteristics, the methodology used, and the outcome measures of amplitude and/or latency of waves I, III, and V. The results indicate a high level of heterogeneity between the studies for all the assessed areas. Amplitude and latency differences between tinnitus and controls were not consistent between studies. Nevertheless, the longer latency and reduced amplitude of wave I for the tinnitus group with normal hearing compared to matched controls was the most consistent finding across studies. These results support the need for greater stratification of the tinnitus population and the importance of a standardized ABR method to make comparisons between studies possible.&#10;~&#10;PMID: 28785218&#10;Journal: Frontiers in aging neuroscience" target="_blank">

Noise&#45;induced cochlear synaptopathy usually leaves cochlear thresholds unaltered, but is associated with long&#45;term reductions in auditory brainstem response (ABR) amplitudes at medium&#45;to&#45;high sound levels. This pathophysiology has been suggested to degrade speech perception in noise (SPiN), perhaps explaining why SPiN ability varies so widely among audiometrically normal humans. The present study is the first to test for evidence of cochlear synaptopathy in humans with significant SPiN impairment. Individuals were recruited on the basis of self&#45;reported SPiN difficulties and normal pure tone audiometric thresholds. Performance on a listening task identified a subset with &#39;verified&#39; SPiN impairment. This group was matched with controls on the basis of age, sex, and audiometric thresholds up to 14 kHz. ABRs and envelope&#45;following responses (EFRs) were recorded at high stimulus levels, yielding both raw amplitude measures and within&#45;subject difference measures. Past exposure to high sound levels was assessed by detailed structured interview. Impaired SPiN was not associated with greater lifetime noise exposure, nor with any electrophysiological measure. It is conceivable that retrospective self&#45;report cannot reliably capture noise exposure, and that ABRs and EFRs offer limited sensitivity to synaptopathy in humans. Nevertheless, the results do not support the notion that noise&#45;induced synaptopathy is a significant etiology of SPiN impairment with normal audiometric thresholds. It may be that synaptopathy alone does not have significant perceptual consequences, or is not widespread in humans with normal audiograms.&#10;~&#10;PMID: 29680183&#10;Journal: Hearing research" target="_blank">

Particularly in rodents, several studies have concluded that exposure to high level octave&#45;band noise for 2 h leads to an irreversible loss of around 50% of synaptic ribbons, leaving audiometric hearing thresholds unaltered. Cochlear synaptopathy following noise exposure is hypothesized to degrade the neural encoding of sounds at the subcortical level, which would help explain certain listening&#45;in&#45;noise difficulties reported by some subjects with otherwise &#39;normal&#39; hearing. In response to this peripheral damage, increased gain of central stages of the auditory system has been observed across several species of mammals, particularly in association with tinnitus. The auditory brainstem response (ABR) wave I amplitude and waves I&#45;V amplitude ratio have been suggested as non&#45;invasive indicators of cochlear synaptopathy and central gain activation respectively, but the evidence for these hearing disorders in humans is inconclusive. In this study, we evaluated the influence of lifetime noise exposure (LNE) on the human ABR and on speech&#45;in&#45;noise intelligibility performance in a large cohort of adults aged 29 to 55. Despite large inter&#45;subject variability, results showed a moderate, but statistically significant, negative correlation between the ABR wave I amplitude and LNE, consistent with cochlear synaptopathy. The results also showed (a) that central gain mechanisms observed in animal studies might also occur in humans, in which higher stages of the auditory pathway appear to compensate for reduced input from the cochlea; (b) that tinnitus was associated with activation of central gain mechanisms; (c) that relevant cognitive and subcortical factors influence speech&#45;in&#45;noise intelligibility, in particular, longer ABR waves I&#45;V interpeak latencies were associated with poorer performance in understanding speech in noise when central gain mechanisms were active; and (d) absence of a significant relationship between LNE and tinnitus, central gain activation or speech&#45;in&#45;noise performance. Although this study supports the possible existence of cochlear synaptopathy in humans, the great degree of variability, the lack of uniformity in central gain activation and the significant involvement of attention in speech&#45;in&#45;noise performance suggests that noise&#45;induced cochlear synaptopathy is, at most, one of several factors that play a role in humans&#39; speech&#45;in&#45;noise performance.&#10;~&#10;PMID: 29913342&#10;Journal: Hearing research" target="_blank">

This has been confirmed in several mammalian species, but the hypothesis that lifetime noise exposure affects auditory function in humans with normal audiometric thresholds remains unconfirmed and current evidence from human electrophysiology is contradictory. Here we report the auditory brainstem response (ABR), and both transient (stimulus onset and offset) and sustained functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) responses throughout the human central auditory pathway across lifetime noise exposure. Healthy young individuals aged 25&#45;40 years were recruited into high (n = 32) and low (n = 30) lifetime noise exposure groups, stratified for age, and balanced for audiometric threshold up to 16 kHz fMRI demonstrated robust broadband noise&#45;related activity throughout the auditory pathway (cochlear nucleus, superior olivary complex, nucleus of the lateral lemniscus, inferior colliculus, medial geniculate body and auditory cortex). fMRI responses in the auditory pathway to broadband noise onset were significantly enhanced in the high noise exposure group relative to the low exposure group, differences in sustained fMRI responses did not reach significance, and no significant group differences were found in the click&#45;evoked ABR. Exploratory analyses found no significant relationships between the neural responses and self&#45;reported tinnitus or reduced sound&#45;level tolerance (symptoms associated with synaptopathy). In summary, although a small effect, these fMRI results suggest that lifetime noise exposure may be associated with central hyperactivity in young adults with normal hearing thresholds.&#10;~&#10;PMID: 31586673&#10;Journal: NeuroImage" target="_blank">

One potential explanation for these &#39;hidden&#39; auditory deficits is loss of the synaptic connections between the inner hair cells and their afferent auditory nerve fiber targets, a condition that has been termed cochlear synaptopathy. In animal models, cochlear synaptopathy can occur due to aging or exposure to noise or ototoxic drugs and is associated with reduced auditory brainstem response (ABR) wave I amplitudes. Decreased ABR wave I amplitudes have been demonstrated among young military Veterans and non&#45;Veterans with a history of firearm use, suggesting that humans may also experience noise&#45;induced synaptopathy. However, the downstream consequences of synaptopathy are unclear. Method To investigate how noise&#45;induced reductions in wave I amplitude impact the central auditory system, the ABR, the middle latency response (MLR), and the late latency response (LLR) were measured in 65 young Veterans and non&#45;Veterans with normal audiograms. Results In response to a click stimulus, the MLR was weaker for Veterans compared to non&#45;Veterans, but the LLR was not reduced. In addition, low ABR wave I amplitudes were associated with a reduced MLR, but with an increased LLR. Notably, Veterans reporting tinnitus showed the largest mean LLRs. Conclusions These findings indicate that decreased peripheral auditory input leads to compensatory gain in the central auditory system, even among individuals with normal audiograms, and may impact auditory perception. This pattern of reduced MLR, but not LLR, was observed among Veterans even after statistical adjustment for sex and distortion product otoacoustic emission differences, suggesting that synaptic loss plays a role in the observed central gain.

Here, we investigate if gain compensation occurs with aging. For 94 people (aged 12&#45;68 years, 64 women, 7 tinnitus) with normal or close&#45;to&#45;normal audiograms, the amplitude of wave I of the auditory brainstem response decreased with increasing age but was not correlated with wave V amplitude after accounting for age&#45;related subclinical hearing loss and cochlear damage, a result indicative of age&#45;related gain compensation. The correlations between age and wave I/III or III/V amplitude ratios suggested that compensation occurs at the wave III generator site. For each one of the seven participants with non&#45;pulsatile tinnitus, the amplitude of wave I, wave V, and the wave I/V amplitude ratio were well within the confidence limits of the non&#45;tinnitus participants.

With strong evidence supporting the benefits of dietary fibre for vascular health and hearing loss, intake of dietary fibre may also have a role in the prevention of tinnitus symptoms. This longitudinal study aims to determine the association between the intake of dietary fibre and other carbohydrate nutrition variables including glycaemic index (GI), glycaemic load (GL) and total carbohydrate intakes, and incident tinnitus over 10 years. Of the 1730 participants (aged ≥50 years) from the Blue Mountains Hearing Study with complete baseline data on tinnitus symptoms and carbohydrate intakes, 536 (31%) cases of tinnitus were identified and excluded from further incidence analysis. Dietary data were collected using a validated semi&#45;quantitative food frequency questionnaire to determine intakes of total dietary fibre and fibre contributions from cereals, vegetables, and fruit. A purpose&#45;built database based on Australian GI values was used to calculate mean GI. Lower versus higher intakes of fruit fibre (≤3.6 g/day vs. &gt;3.6 g/day) and cereal fibre (≤4.2 g/day vs. &gt;4.2 g/day) were significantly associated with a 65% (HR = 1.65; 95% CI: 1.15&#45;2.36) and 54% (HR = 1.54; 95% CI: 1.07&#45;2.22) increased risk of developing tinnitus over 10 years, respectively. Associations between intake of other carbohydrate nutrients and incident tinnitus were mostly non&#45;significant. In summary, our study showed modest associations between intake of dietary fibre and incident tinnitus. The protective effects of fibre, particularly insoluble fibre, could underlie observed associations by reducing the risk of tinnitus via vascular risk factors such as cardiovascular disease. Further longitudinal studies evaluating different types and sources of fibre and tinnitus risk are needed to confirm our study findings.&#10;~&#10;PMID: 34836381&#10;Journal: Nutrients" target="_blank">
