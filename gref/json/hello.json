Advances in ophthalmology", "date": "1999", "abstract": "Cystoid macular edema (CME) is a classical complication of ocular inflammation. This syndrome was already described by Irvine in 1953 but the pathogenesis of this condition remains unclear. Cystoid macular edema can result either from a rupture of the inner or from the outer blood ocular barrier. Clinical CME that is responsible for a low visual acuity must be differentiated from angiographic CME that can be present even without any decrease in visual acuity. Fluid progressively accumulates into the outer plexiform layer of the retina and pools into cystic spaces. Fluid accumulation can now be better seen with optical coherence tomography (OCT). In chronic CME fluid accumulation is associated with thinning of the retina and fibrosis. At this stage irreversible lesions are present and CME does not respond to medical therapies. Inflammatory CME must be differentiated from CME resulting from irreversible vascular damage such as in diabetic CME or due to vein occlusions. Experimental research on cystoid macular edema has been hampered by the lack of animal model: most of laboratory animals have no macula, monkeys appear to be highly resistant to macular edema. Five major causes have been suspected to be at the origin of CME: (1) photic retinopathy, (2) trauma of ocular tissue, (3) secondary irritation of the ciliary body, (4) vitreous traction and (5) pharmaceutically induced CME. Clinical experience has shown that pseudophakic CME usually responds well to local therapy of steroids and non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and/or in association with systemic acetazolamide. Acetazolamide is increasing fluid resorption through the retinal pigment epithelium. Postoperative CME rarely needs additional posterior subtenon's injections to resolve. But in CME occurring secondary to uveitis additional posterior sub-Tenon's steroid injections or systemic steroids may be necessary to decrease the constant release of inflammatory mediators.", "references": ["22822783", "6463851", "7437393", "2361736", "2211037", "7029388", "6540483", "869422", "8508336", "7043873", "2696710", "5955948", "518390", "4632472", "7387520", "3494559", "2778762", "5934962", "3068282", "3428394", "2803090", "1614102", "479006", "8056514", "412691", "3415543", "3497100", "8977222", "6752799", "6634079", "8133491", "2243674", "7409984", "13040458", "3231908"], "citedin": ["28356704", "28299006", "27630374", "26975399", "26244973", "25756062", "25136452", "24788977", "23836953", "22707339", "22535323", "22096351", "22094296", "20927757", "20238484", "19756184", "19668543", "19668445", "19668442", "17356517", "17219109", "17148663", "16896918", "15747121", "15654595", "15090421", "14504894"], "five": ["27749791", "25863671", "16271177", "10328408", "32092363"]}, "27749791": {"pmid": "27749791", "title": "POSSIBLE EFFICACY OF TOPICAL DORZOLAMIDE IN THE TREATMENT OF PACLITAXEL-RELATED CYSTOID MACULAR EDEMA.", "authors": [[null, "Dwivedi, Rahul R"], [null, "Tiroumal, Sambath S"]], "journal": "Retinal cases & brief reports", "date": "2018 Winter", "abstract": "Paclitaxel (Taxol) is a microtubule-stabilizing agent and belongs to the taxane group of chemotherapeutic drugs.

Uveitis is a leading cause of visual loss, most commonly due to uveitic macular oedema (UMO). Treatment is aimed at reducing disease activity by suppression of the intraocular inflammatory response. In the case of macular oedema, the aim is to restore macular architecture as quickly as possible, in order to prevent irreversible photoreceptor damage in this area. Acute exacerbations are typically managed with corticosteroids, which may be administered topically, locally or systemically. Whilst these are often rapidly effective in achieving disease control, long-term use is associated with significant local and systemic side effects, and 'steroid sparing agents' are typically used to achieve prolonged control in severe or recalcitrant disease. Anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) drugs block a critical cytokine in the inflammatory signalling process, and have emerged as effective steroid-sparing immunomodulatory agents in a wide range of non-ocular conditions. There is mechanistic data to suggest that they may provide a more targeted approach to disease control in UMO than other agents, but to date, these agents have predominantly been used 'off label' as the majority are not licensed for ocular use.
