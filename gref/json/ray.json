Primary RP occurs without underlying disease and is considered a benign condition. A normal erythrocyte sedimentation rate, negative testing for antinuclear antibodies, normal nailfold capillaries and the absence of structural micro- or macrovascular damage and other diseases lead to the diagnosis of primary RP. Digital photoplethysmography and pulse contour analysis can be used as an additional tool to exclude structural macro- or microvascular disease. In contrast, secondary RP is associated with other diseases, mainly connective tissue diseases such as systemic sclerosis.

Population studies have shown that RP in adults is more common in women than men, with prevalence estimates ranging from 4% to 30%. Geographic variations in the prevalence reflect differences in climate. RP may be a primary or a secondary process. LeRoy and Medsger suggested criteria for primary RP: symmetric attacks, the absence of tissue necrosis, ulceration or gangrene, the absence of a secondary cause, negative antinuclear antibodies, normal nailfold capillaroscopy and a normal erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Secondary RP is characterized by an age of onset of more than 30 years, painful and asymmetric attacks, ischemic skin lesions, positive autoantibodies, capillaroscopic abnormalities and/or clinical features suggestive of connective tissue diseases (CTDs). Among the CTDs, systemic sclerosis has the highest frequency of RP. Finding a cause for RP requires a knowledge of the patient's occupational, smoking, drug history, physical examination, nailfold capillaroscopy, routine laboratory tests and autoantibodies. Furthermore, RP should be distinguished from acrocyanosis, a condition characterized by continuous cyanosis of the hands or feet that is aggravated by cold temperature. The most important instruction to the patient is abstinence from any smoking, offending drugs should be discontinued, and abrupt changes in temperature.

SUMMARY: Background Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is associated with a high risk of recurrent events after withdrawal of anticoagulation. Objectives To determine the difference in plasma clot mechanical properties between patients with recurrent VTE (rVTE) and those with non-recurrent VTE (nrVTE). Methods We previously developed a system for determining clot mechanical properties by use of an in-house magnetic tweezers system. This system was used to determine the mechanical properties of clots made from plasma of 11 patients with rVTE and 33 with nrVTE. Plasma was mixed with micrometer-sized beads, and thrombin and calcium were added to induce clotting; the mixture was then placed in small capillary tubes, and clotting was allowed to proceed overnight. Bead displacements upon manipulation with magnetic forces were analyzed to determine clot elastic and viscous moduli. Fibrin clot structure was analyzed with turbidimetry and confocal microscopy. Factor\u00a0XIII was measured by pentylamine incorporation into fibrin. Results Clots from rVTE patients showed nearly two-fold less elastic and less viscous moduli than clots from nrVTE patients, regardless of male sex, unprovoked events, family history of VTE, fibrinogen concentration, or body mass index. No differences were observed in clot structure, fibrinolysis rates, or FXIII levels. Conclusion Using magnetic tweezers for the first time in patient samples, we found that plasma clots from rVTE patients showed a reduced elastic modulus and a reduced viscous modulus as compared with clots from nrVTE patients. These data indicate a possible role for fibrin clot viscoelastic properties in determining VTE recurrence.", "references": ["28166607", "26608329", "16102026", "29242187", "30725502", "24840618", "22463367", "10737275", "24414255", "21325668", "22367958", "19690336", "4425722", "7495075", "24430058", "14675106", "26589270", "21131039", "26773756", "28062504", "26743168", "20923635", "23240024"], "citedin": ["34680169", "34633287", "34606991", "34183396", "34037437", "33562624", "33462294", "33313466", "31614389"], "five": ["31323706", "28062504", "33562624", "19690336", "31479942"]}, "33562624": {"pmid": "33562624", "title": "Factor XIII and Fibrin Clot Properties in Acute Venous Thromboembolism.", "authors": [["0000-0003-1762-308X", "Z\u0105bczyk, Micha\u0142 M"], [null, "Natorska, Joanna J"], [null, "Undas, Anetta A"]], "journal": "International journal of molecular sciences", "date": "2021 Feb 05", "abstract": "Coagulation factor XIII (FXIII) is converted by thrombin into its active form, FXIIIa, which crosslinks fibrin fibers, rendering clots more stable and resistant to degradation.

Fibrin clot structure characterized by fiber diameter and pore size differs between healthy persons and those with thromboembolic diseases, in part due to the quality and quantity of fibrinogen and the magnitude of thrombin generation. A key measure of plasma clot structure is its permeability, reflected by the Darcy constant (Ks). Reduced Ks is a typical feature of the prothrombotic fibrin clot phenotype, which is associated with faster formation of denser fibrin mesh, relatively resistant to lysis. Low Ks has been reported in patients with prior or acute myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, or venous thromboembolism (encompassing deep vein thrombosis [DVT] and pulmonary embolism [PE]), as well as in those with prothrombotic conditions (eg, in several thrombophilic states) and in the presence of cardiovascular risk factors (eg, obesity). Antithrombotic and anticoagulant agents, along with statins, have been shown to increase Ks. Growing evidence indicates associations between the properties of plasma fibrin clots and morphology of intravascular thrombi in patients with MI. Recently, reduced Ks has been shown to predict recurrent thromboembolic episodes in patients with a history of stroke, PE, DVT, and their serious complications, including postthrombotic syndrome and thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension.

The aim of the present pilot study was to investigate the alterations in fibrinogen structure and function in patients with cirrhosis of various severity and to correlate these findings with the mechanisms of thrombus formation. We assessed in plasma specific oxidative stress markers and measured oxidative modifications, functional and structural parameters in purified fibrinogen fractions obtained from cirrhotic patients and control subjects. We enrolled 15 cirrhotic patients (5 patients belonging to each of the three Child-Turcotte-Pugh classes) and 20 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Plasma redox status, fibrinogen oxidative modifications, thrombin-catalyzed fibrin polymerization and fibrin resistance to plasmin-induced lysis were significantly altered in cirrhotic patients and were associated to disease severity. Importantly, clot structure obtained by stimulated emission depletion (STED) super-resolution microscopy indicated modifications in fiber diameter and in clot porosity in cirrhotic patients. Fibrin fiber diameter significantly decreased in cirrhotic patients when compared to controls, and this difference became more marked with disease progression. In parallel, fibrin pore size progressively decreased along with disease severity. In cirrhotic patients, fibrinogen clot analysis and oxidative-dependent changes reveal novel structural and functional fibrinogen modifications which may favor thrombotic complications in cirrhosis.", "references": ["23381015", "14961153", "19803748", "23809133", "25284616", "23305734", "17406547", "21836064", "27755019", "20400681", "24718401", "24627592", "1420861", "26833718", "15864538", "19690336", "20537738", "26585672", "20348406", "29483085", "26357663", "16917107", "12192305", "28740853", "17006940", "26494231", "22384068", "26484638", "24790138", "25074740", "7835749", "21751907", "17635717", "20075386", "4541913", "10595642", "32001151", "26786481", "25848469", "24064886", "28101869", "18443906", "23662248", "24899357", "12614167", "30472725", "30945230", "21145851", "32039373", "26540040", "14661084", "17316874", "27761574"], "citedin": [], "five": ["26833718", "24790138", "27755019", "25900310", "22378816"]}, "32076463": {"pmid": "32076463", "title": "Plasma Fibrin Clot Properties as Determinants of Bleeding Time in Human Subjects: Association with Histidine-Rich Glycoprotein.", "authors": [[null, "Szu\u0142drzy\u0144ski, Konstanty K"], [null, "Jankowski, Mi\u0142osz M"], ["0000-0003-0324-8506", "Potaczek, Daniel P DP"], ["0000-0002-0667-8109", "Undas, Anetta A"]], "journal": "Disease markers", "date": "2020", "abstract": "Fibrin formation and histidine-rich glycoprotein (HRG) are involved in primary hemostasis and wound healing.

Here we studied alterations of the fibrin clot properties in relation to disease severity in SLE patients. Plasma clots from 28 SLE patients were characterized by the kinetics of formation and fibrinolytic dissolution (using dynamic turbidimetry), the network and fiber ultrastructure (scanning electron microscopy), viscoelasticity (shear rheometry), and the rate and degree of crosslinking (Western blotting) correlated with the disease activity, blood composition, and compared to clotting of pooled normal human plasma. Clots made from plasma of SLE patients were lysed faster with exogenous t-PA than control clots from normal plasma without a significant difference between those from active (SLEDAI>4) and inactive (SLEDAI<4) SLE patients. Clots from the blood of patients with active SLE were characterized by significantly slower onset, but faster rate of fibrin polymerization and a higher optical density due to thicker fibers compared to those from inactive SLE and control pooled normal plasma. The rheological parameters of the clots (storage and loss moduli) were significantly increased in the active SLE patients along with enhanced fibrin crosslinking and hyperfibrinogenemia. The structural and rheological alterations displayed a strong positive correlation with high fibrinogen levels and other laboratory markers of immune inflammation. In conclusion, changes in the blood composition associated with active systemic inflammation in SLE cause significant alterations in the lytic resistance of fibrin clots associated with changes in polymerization kinetics, viscoelastic properties, and structure. The formation of more rigid prothrombotic fibrin clots in the plasma of SLE patients is likely due to the inflammatory hyperfibrinogenemia and greater extent of crosslinking. However, the higher susceptibility of the SLE clots to fibrinolysis may be a protective and/or compensatory mechanism that reduces the risk of thrombotic complications and improves patient outcomes.", "references": ["10545379", "10634794", "10807754", "1176815", "12162688", "12370216", "12642590", "1341057", "1420861", "1447176", "14507110", "14530779", "1455397", "15015972", "15026315", "15468356", "15934123", "16126968", "16142761", "16420554", "16645994", "16917107", "17469158", "1756253", "17640649", "17646899", "18305268", "19136143", "19154576", "19155517", "19797520", "20471669", "20477646", "2122531", "21245073", "21355090", "22129255", "22580301", "23293023", "23305734", "23490277", "23504607", "23832292", "23877806", "24237152", "24261582", "24414255", "24430058", "24652596", "25246564", "25714359", "25890027", "25908929", "2605181", "26540111", "26635081", "26773122", "26980741", "27056152", "27167859", "27188843", "27553509", "27942000", "27981815", "28101869", "28262199", "28630861", "28785035", "29658191", "3144407", "3187937", "4089825", "6121390", "7578900", "7961782", "8849381", "9092031", "9153217", "9324032", "9458205"], "citedin": ["34680169", "34560207", "33748254", "33322373", "33252741", "32991476"], "five": ["16091450", "29295895", "31921206", "31752041", "24414255", "28166607"]}}
