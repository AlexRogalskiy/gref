However, even if an invisibility cloak based on visible rays is used, an infrared (IR) thermography camera can detect the heat (thermal radiation) emitted from different types of objects including living things. Therefore, both visible and IR rays should be shielded using an invisibility cloak produced by an appropriate technology. Herein, we developed a textile cloak that can almost completely conceal people or objects from IR vision. If a person or object is covered with an IR- and thermal-radiation-shielding textile woven with polyurethane (PU)-tin oxide (SnO2) composite microtubes, serving as an IR invisibility cloak, IR and thermal radiation emitted from the person or object can be simultaneously blocked. Furthermore, the IR- and thermal-radiation-shielding characteristics could be improved further by filling the core of the PU-SnO2 composite microtubes with heat-absorbing materials such as water and paraffin oil in place of air. In addition, the external surface of the IR- and thermal-radiation-shielding textile serving as an IR-reflecting cloak can be waterproofed to enable certain IR- and thermal-radiation-shielding functions under various environmental conditions.", "references": [], "citedin": [], "five": ["23609653", "23004890", "21643114", "22355767", "27329510", "25928664"]}, "21643114": {"pmid": "21643114", "title": "Homogeneous optical cloak constructed with uniform layered structures.", "authors": [[null, "Zhang, Jingjing J"], [null, "Liu, Liu L"], [null, "Luo, Yu Y"], [null, "Zhang, Shuang S"], [null, "Mortensen, Niels Asger NA"]], "journal": "Optics express", "date": "2011 Apr 25", "abstract": "The prospect of rendering objects invisible has intrigued researchers for centuries.

The ground plane cloak obtained with the rigorous transformation optics possesses moderate anisotropic distributions of material parameters, but results in no lateral shift of the scattering fields. To realize the design, a possible scheme is suggested by discretizing the ground plane cloak to several homogeneous sub-blocks. These sub-blocks can be realized with multilayer isotropic dielectrics with alignment angles that are determined by the effective medium theory. Thus the non-magnetic ground plane invisibility cloak can be constructed by several multilayered normal dielectrics aligned in different angles. The performance of the proposed cloak and its practical implementation is validated by full-wave electromagnetic simulations with both near field distributions and far field scattering patterns under different EM wave incident angles.

The first free-space and carpet cloaks were realized in the microwave frequencies using metamaterials. The free-space cloak was composed of resonant metamaterials, and hence had restriction of narrow bandwidth and high loss; the carpet cloak was made of non-resonant metamaterials, which have broad bandwidth and low loss. However, the carpet cloak has a severe restriction of large size compared to the cloaked object. The above restrictions become the bottlenecks to the real applications of free-space and carpet cloaks.

Here, we present an experimental realization of a cloak design that conceals a perturbation on a flat conducting plane, under which an object can be hidden. To match the complex spatial distribution of the required constitutive parameters, we constructed a metamaterial consisting of thousands of elements, the geometry of each element determined by an automated design process. The ground-plane cloak can be realized with the use of nonresonant metamaterial elements, resulting in a structure having a broad operational bandwidth (covering the range of 13 to 16 gigahertz in our experiment) and exhibiting extremely low loss. Our experimental results indicate that this type of cloak should scale well toward optical wavelengths.", "references": [], "citedin": ["34845258", "34692075", "34640103", "34451042", "34158568", "34038615", "34017025", "33922987", "33833215", "33790227", "33748763", "33670875", "32967829", "32921231", "32788706", "32777776", "32724073", "31804518", "31649270", "31549087", "31547504", "30931963", "30839599", "30479931", "30424097", "30167205", "30167164", "30167131", "30111878", "29938186", "29855538", "29491430", "29077036", "28932671", "28900223", "28860649", "28839171", "28774128", "28699634", "28638137", "28607464", "28386065", "28252031", "28239535", "28106115", "27958334", "27886208", "27774997", "27708395", "27605153", "27578317", "27439474", "27406699", "27329510", "27001451", "26902969", "26900513", "26891773", "26803985", "26658471", "26603312", "26596641", "26552343", "26272748", "26217057", "26217054", "26140612", "26122861", "26056299", "25997798", "25858295", "25766083", "25746689", "25726924", "25716451", "25370447", "25359138", "25231412", "25089367", "25034268", "25008374", "24608143", "24522638", "24522287", "24356577", "24338738", "24285220", "24153410", "23921452", "23851589", "23756877", "23739327", "23712699", "23549139", "23535875", "23202472", "23169054", "23149743", "23142840", "22870387", "22531179", "22355767", "22355597", "21711711", "21709266", "21331038", "21285954", "21119637", "20975696", "20414221", "20400955", "20023631", "19561598", "19543308", "19404237"], "five": ["21164794", "19997219", "21405230", "20975696", "23169054", "17053110", "21997059"]}, "19113341": {"pmid": "19113341", "title": "Hiding under the carpet: a new strategy for cloaking.", "authors": [[null, "Li, Jensen J"], [null, "Pendry, J B JB"]], "journal": "Physical review letters", "date": "2008 Nov 14", "abstract": "A new type of cloak is discussed: one that gives all cloaked objects the appearance of a flat conducting sheet.

Generally, the electromagnetic parameters of invisibility cloaks are complicated tensors, yet difficult to realize. As a special method of transformation optics, conformal mapping helps us design invisibility cloak with isotropic materials of a refractive index distribution. However, for all proposed isotropic cloaks, the refractive index range is at such a breadth that challenges current experimental fabrication. In this work, we propose two new kinds of logarithm conformal mappings for invisible device designs. For one of the mappings, the refractive index distribution of conformal cloak varies from 0 to 9.839, which is more feasible for future implementation. Numerical simulations by using finite element method are performed to confirm the theoretical analysis.", "references": ["21285954", "16728597", "19150842", "22355597", "19404237", "16728596", "20975696", "19113341", "20940924", "20173844", "21405275", "17995408", "23851589", "20299551", "21619019"], "citedin": ["27922082"], "five": ["27922082", "22355767", "23851589", "21164794", "21285954", "29938186"]}, "21119637": {"pmid": "21119637", "title": "Three-dimensional broadband and broad-angle transformation-optics lens.", "authors": [[null, "Ma, Hui Feng HF"], [null, "Cui, Tie Jun TJ"]], "journal": "Nature communications", "date": "2010 Nov 23", "abstract": "Luneburg lenses have superior performance compared with conventional lenses made of uniform materials with specially designed surfaces, but they are restricted by the difficulty of manufacturing the required gradient-index materials and their spherical focal surfaces. Recently, a new two-dimensional (2D) imaging lens was proposed and realized using transformation optics. Such a 2D lens overcomes the aberration problem, has a flattened focal surface and is valid for extremely large viewing angles. Here, we show the design, realization and measurement of a three-dimensional (3D) approximate transformation-optics lens in the microwave frequency band.

However, in 2006, invisibility became a practical matter for the scientific community as well, with the suggestion that artificially structured metamaterials could enable a new electromagnetic design paradigm, now termed transformation optics. Since the advent of transformation optics and subsequent initial demonstration of the microwave cloak, the field has grown rapidly. However, the complexity of the transformation optics material prescription has continually forced researchers to make simplifying approximations to achieve even a subset of the desired functionality.
