Title: Balance diagnostics for comparing the distribution of baseline covariates between treatment groups in propensity-score matched samples.
By: Austin
~
Abstract: The propensity score is a subject's probability of treatment, conditional on observed baseline covariates. Conditional on the true propensity score, treated and untreated subjects have similar distributions of observed baseline covariates. Propensity-score matching is a popular method of using the propensity score in the medical literature. Using this approach, matched sets of treated and untreated subjects with similar values of the propensity score are formed. Inferences about treatment effect made using propensity-score matching are valid only if, in the matched sample, treated and untreated subjects have similar distributions of measured baseline covariates. In this paper we discuss the following methods for assessing whether the propensity score model has been correctly specified: comparing means and prevalences of baseline characteristics using standardized differences; ratios comparing the variance of continuous covariates between treated and untreated subjects; comparison of higher order moments and interactions; five-number summaries; and graphical methods such as quantile-quantile plots, side-by-side boxplots, and non-parametric density plots for comparing the distribution of baseline covariates between treatment groups. We describe methods to determine the sampling distribution of the standardized difference when the true standardized difference is equal to zero, thereby allowing one to determine the range of standardized differences that are plausible with the propensity score model having been correctly specified. We highlight the limitations of some previously used methods for assessing the adequacy of the specification of the propensity-score model. In particular, methods based on comparing the distribution of the estimated propensity score between treated and untreated subjects are uninformative.

Abstract: Dabigatran is approved for stroke risk reduction in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF). Data from diverse clinical practice settings will help establish whether the risk:benefit ratio seen in clinical trials is comparable with routine clinical care. This study aimed to compare the safety and effectiveness of dabigatran and warfarin in clinical practice. We undertook a propensity score-matched (PSM) cohort study (N=12,793 per group; mean age 74) comparing treatment with dabigatran or warfarin in the US Department of Defense claims database, October 2009 to July 2013. Treatment-naïve patients with first prescription claim for dabigatran (either FDA-approved dose) or warfarin between October 2010 and July 2012 (index) and a diagnosis of NVAF during the 12 months before index date were included. Primary outcomes were stroke and major bleeding. Secondary outcomes included ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke, major gastrointestinal (GI), urogenital or other bleeding, myocardial infarction (MI) and death. Time-to-event was investigated using Kaplan-Meier survival analyses. Outcomes comparisons were made utilising Cox-proportional hazards models of PSM groups. Dabigatran users experienced fewer strokes (adjusted hazard ratio [95 % confidence intervals] 0.73 [0.55-0.97]), major intracranial (0.49 [0.30-0.79]), urogenital (0.36 [0.18-0.74]) and other (0.38 [0.22-0.66]) bleeding, MI (0.65 [0.45-0.95]) and deaths (0.64 [0.55-0.74]) than the warfarin group. Major bleeding (0.87 [0.74-1.03]) and major GI bleeding (1.13 [0.94-1.37]) was similar between groups and major lower GI bleeding events were more frequent (1.30 [1.04-1.62]) with dabigatran. In conclusion, compared with warfarin, dabigatran treatment was associated with a lower risk of stroke and most outcomes measured, but increased incidence of major lower GI bleeding.

Abstract: The RE-LY study demonstrated the safety and efficacy of dabigatran relative to warfarin for stroke prevention in non-valvular atrial fibrillation. It is important to further evaluate safety and effectiveness of drugs in routine care. This study used a sequential cohort design with propensity score matching to compare dabigatran with warfarin among patients in two commercial health insurance databases. New users of these anticoagulants were followed from initiation until discontinuation, the end of the study, or the occurrence of a study outcome (primary study outcomes were stroke and major bleeding). Proportional hazards regression was conducted separately within each data source and results were pooled. Among 19,189 matched dabigatran and warfarin initiators (mean age: 68 years, 36 % female), as-treated follow-up (average of 5 months for dabigatran, 4 months for warfarin) identified 62 and 69 strokes, respectively (pooled HR = 0.77; 95 % CI = 0.54 to 1.09), and 354 and 395 major haemorrhages, respectively (HR = 0.75; 0.65 to 0.87). No meaningful heterogeneity was identified across subgroups, but numeric trends suggest more pronounced stroke prevention by dabigatran relative to warfarin among patients age 75+ (HR = 0.57; 0.33 to 0.97) or with < 6 months of use (HR = 0.51; 0.19 to 1.42). Major bleeds were reduced more by dabigatran among patients aged < 55 (HR = 0.51; 0.30 to 0.87) and with CHADS2 < 2 (HR = 0.58; 0.44 to 0.77). In conclusion, in routine care of patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation, dabigatran treatment resulted in improved health outcomes compared with warfarin.

Abstract: The choice of oral anticoagulant (OAC) for patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) may be influenced by individual clinical features or by patterns of risk factors and comorbidities. We reviewed analyses of subgroups of patients from trials of vitamin K antagonists vs. non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOACs) for stroke prevention in AF with the aim to identify patient groups who might benefit from a particular OAC more than from another. In addition, we discuss the timing of initiation of anticoagulation. In the second of a two-part review, we discuss the use of NOAC for stroke prevention in the following subgroups of patients with AF: (vii) secondary stroke prevention in patients after stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA), (viii) patients with acute stroke requiring thrombolysis or thrombectomy, (ix) those initiating or restarting OAC treatment after stroke or TIA, (x) those with renal impairment on dialysis, (xi) the elderly, (xii) those at high risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, and (xiii) those with hypertension. In addition, we discuss adherence and compliance. Finally, we present a summary of treatment suggestions. In specific subgroups of patients with AF, evidence supports the use of particular NOACs and/or particular doses of anticoagulant. The appropriate choice of treatment for these subgroups will help to promote optimal clinical outcomes.

Abstract: In addition to warfarin, there are four non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) available for stroke prevention in non valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF). There are limited data on the comparative risks of major bleeding among newly anticoagulated NVAF patients who initiate warfarin, apixaban, dabigatran, or rivaroxaban, when used in 'real world' clinical practice. The study used the Truven MarketScan® Commercial & Medicare supplemental US claims database. NVAF patients aged ≥18 years newly prescribed an oral anticoagulant 01JAN2013-31DEC2014, with a ≥1-year baseline period, were included (study period: 01JAN2012-31DEC2014). Major bleeding was defined as bleeding requiring hospitalisation. Propensity score matching (PSM) was used to balance age, sex, region, baseline comorbidities, and comedications. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the PSM hazard ratio (HR) of major bleeding. Among 45,361 newly anticoagulated NVAF patients, 15,461 (34.1 %) initiated warfarin, 7,438 (16.4 %) initiated apixaban, 17,801 (39.2 %) initiated rivaroxaban, and 4,661 (10.3 %) initiated dabigatran. Compared to matched warfarin initiators, apixaban (HR: 0.53; 95 % CI: 0.39-0.71) and dabigatran (HR: 0.69; 95 % CI: 0.50-0.96) initiators had a significantly lower risk of major bleeding. Patients initiating rivaroxaban (HR: 0.98; 95 % CI: 0.83-1.17) had a non-significant difference in major bleeding risk compared to matched warfarin patients. When comparisons were made between NOACs, matched rivaroxaban patients had a significantly higher risk of major bleeding (HR: 1.82; 95 % CI: 1.36-2.43) compared to apixaban patients. The differences for apixaban-dabigatran and dabigatran-rivaroxaban matched cohorts were not statistically significant. Among newly anticoagulated NVAF patients in the real-world setting, apixaban and dabigatran initiation was associated with significantly lower risk of major bleeding compared to warfarin initiation. When compared to apixaban, rivaroxaban initiation was associated with significantly higher risk of major bleeding.

~
Abstract: Approximately 1 in 3-4 patients presenting with an ischemic stroke will also have atrial fibrillation (AF), and AF-related strokes can be effectively prevented using oral anticoagulant therapy (OAC), either with well-controlled vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) or non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs). In addition, OAC use (both VKAs and NOACs) is associated with a 26% reduction in all-cause mortality (VKAs) or an additional 10% mortality reduction with NOACs relative to VKAs. The decision to use OAC in individual AF patient is based on the estimated balance of the benefit from ischemic stroke reduction against the risk of major OAC-related bleeding [essentially intracranial hemorrhage (ICH)]. Better appreciation of the importance of VKAs' anticoagulation quality [a target time in therapeutic range (TTR) of ≥70%] and the availability of NOACs (which offer better safety compared to VKAs) have decreased the estimated threshold for OAC treatment in AF patients towards lower stroke risk levels. Still, contemporary registry-based data show that OAC is often underused in AF patients at increased risk of stroke. The uncertainty whether to use OAC may be particularly pronounced in AF patients with a single additional stroke risk factor, who are often (mis)perceived as having a 'borderline' or insufficient stroke risk to trigger the use of OAC. However, observational data from real-world AF cohorts show that the annual stroke rates in such patients are higher than in patients with no additional stroke risk factors, and OAC use has been associated with reduction in stroke, systemic embolism, or death in comparison to no therapy or aspirin, with no increase in the risk of bleeding relative to aspirin. In this review article, we summarize the basic principles of stroke risk stratification in AF patients and discuss contemporary real-world evidence on OAC use and outcomes of OAC treatment in AF patients with a single additional stroke risk factor in various real-world AF cohorts.

Title: Effectiveness and safety of reduced dose non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants and warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation: propensity weighted nationwide cohort study.
By: Nielsen, Skjøth, Søgaard, Kjældgaard, Lip, Larsen
~
Abstract: Objective To examine clinical effectiveness and safety of apixaban 2.5 mg, dabigatran 110 mg, and rivaroxaban 15 mg compared with warfarin among patients with atrial fibrillation who had not previously taken an oral anticoagulant.Design Propensity weighted (inverse probability of treatment weighted) nationwide cohort study.Setting Individual linked data from three nationwide registries in Denmark.Participants Patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation filling a first prescription for an oral anticoagulant from August 2011 to February 2016. Patients who filled a prescription for a standard dose non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant (novel oral anticoagulants, NOACs) were excluded. To control for baseline differences in the population, a propensity score for receipt of either of the four treatment alternatives was calculated to apply an inverse probability treatment weight.Intervention Initiated anticoagulant treatment (dabigatran 110 mg, rivaroxaban 15 mg, apixaban 2.5 mg, and warfarin).Main outcome measures Patients were followed in the registries from onset of treatment for the primary effectiveness outcome of ischaemic stroke/systemic embolism and for the principal safety outcome of any bleeding events.Results Among 55 644 patients with atrial fibrillation who met inclusion criteria, the cohort was distributed according to treatment: apixaban n=4400; dabigatran n=8875; rivaroxaban n=3476; warfarin n=38 893. The overall mean age was 73.9 (SD 12.7), ranging from a mean of 71.0 (warfarin) to 83.9 (apixaban). During one year of follow-up, apixaban was associated with higher (weighted) event rate of ischaemic stroke/systemic embolism (4.8%), while dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and warfarin had event rates of 3.3%, 3.5%, and 3.7%, respectively. In the comparison between a non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant and warfarin in the inverse probability of treatment weighted analyses and investigation of the effectiveness outcome, the hazard ratios were 1.19 (95% confidence interval 0.95 to 1.49) for apixaban, 0.89 (0.77 to 1.03) for dabigatran, and 0.89 (0.69 to 1.16) for rivaroxaban. For the principal safety outcome versus warfarin, the hazard ratios were 0.96 (0.73 to 1.27) for apixaban, 0.80 (0.70 to 0.92) for dabigatran, and 1.06 (0.87 to 1.29) for rivaroxaban.Conclusion In this propensity weighted nationwide study of reduced dose non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant regimens, apixaban 2.5 mg twice a day was associated with a trend towards higher rates of ischaemic stroke/systemic embolism compared with warfarin, while rivaroxaban 15 mg once a day and dabigatran 110 mg twice a day showed a trend towards lower thromboembolic rates. The results were not significantly different. Rates of bleeding (the principal safety outcome) were significantly lower for dabigatran, but not significantly different for apixaban and rivaroxaban compared with warfarin.

Abstract: The ARISTOTLE trial showed a risk reduction of stroke/systemic embolism (SE) and major bleeding in non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) patients treated with apixaban compared to warfarin. This retrospective study used four large US claims databases (MarketScan, PharMetrics, Optum, and Humana) of NVAF patients newly initiating apixaban or warfarin from January 1, 2013 to September 30, 2015. After 1:1 warfarin-apixaban propensity score matching (PSM) within each database, the resulting patient records were pooled. Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the cumulative incidence and hazard ratios (HRs) of stroke/SE and major bleeding (identified using the first listed diagnosis of inpatient claims) within one year of therapy initiation. The study included a total of 76,940 (38,470 warfarin and 38,470 apixaban) patients. Among the 38,470 matched pairs, 14,563 were from MarketScan, 7,683 were from PharMetrics, 7,894 were from Optum, and 8,330 were from Humana. Baseline characteristics were balanced between the two cohorts with a mean (standard deviation [SD]) age of 71 (12) years and a mean (SD) CHA2DS2-VASc score of 3.2 (1.7). Apixaban initiators had a significantly lower risk of stroke/SE (HR: 0.67, 95 % CI: 0.59-0.76) and major bleeding (HR: 0.60, 95 % CI: 0.54-0.65) than warfarin initiators. Different types of stroke/SE and major bleeding - including ischaemic stroke, haemorrhagic stroke, SE, intracranial haemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding, and other major bleeding - were all significantly lower for apixaban compared to warfarin treatment. Subgroup analyses (apixaban dosage, age strata, CHA2DS2-VASc or HAS-BLED score strata, or dataset source) all show consistently lower risks of stroke/SE and major bleeding associated with apixaban as compared to warfarin treatment. This is the largest 'real-world' study on apixaban effectiveness and safety to date, showing that apixaban initiation was associated with significant risk reductions in stroke/SE and major bleeding compared to warfarin initiation after PSM. These benefits were consistent across various high-risk subgroups and both the standard- and low-dose apixaban dose regimens.

Title: Evaluation of bleeding in patients receiving direct oral anticoagulants.
By: Hellenbart, Faulkenberg, Finks
~
Abstract: Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are recognized by evidence-based treatment guidelines as the first-line option for the treatment of venous thromboembolism and prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. As use of these anticoagulants has become favored over the past several years, reported bleeding-related adverse drug events with these agents has increased. In randomized clinical trials, all DOACs have a reduced risk for intracranial hemorrhage, while major and other bleeding results have varied among the agents compared to vitamin K antagonists. We have reviewed the bleeding incidence and severity from randomized and real-world data in patients receiving DOACs in an effort to provide the clinician with a critical review of bleeding and offer practical considerations for avoiding adverse events with these anticoagulants.

Title: Pharmacological and Non-pharmacological Treatments for Stroke Prevention in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation.
By: Ueberham, Dagres, Potpara, Bollmann, Hindricks
~
Abstract: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with significant risk of stroke and other thromboembolic events, which can be effectively prevented using oral anticoagulation (OAC) with either vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) or non-VKA oral anticoagulants (NOACs) dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, or edoxaban. Until recently, VKAs were the only available means for OAC treatment. NOACs had similar efficacy and were safer than or as safe as warfarin with respect to reduced rates of hemorrhagic stroke or other intracranial bleeding in the respective pivotal randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of stroke prevention in non-valvular AF patients. Increasing 'real-world' evidence on NOACs broadly confirms the results of the RCTs. However, individual patient characteristics including renal function, age, or prior bleeding should be taken into account when choosing the OAC with best risk-benefit profile. In patients ineligible for OACs, surgical or interventional stroke prevention strategies should be considered. In patients undergoing cardiac surgery for other reasons, the left atrial appendage excision, ligation, or amputation may be the best option. Importantly, residual stumps or insufficient ligation may result in even higher stroke risk than without intervention. Percutaneous left atrial appendage occlusion, although requiring minimally invasive access, failed to demonstrate reduced ischemic stroke events compared to warfarin. In this review article, we summarize current treatment options and discuss the strengths and major limitations of the therapies for stroke risk reduction in patients with AF.

Title: Real-world Data and Recommended Dosage of Non-vitamin K Oral Anticoagulants for Korean Patients.
By: Joung
~
Abstract: Regulatory approvals of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) have been based on large randomized phase III trials evaluating dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, or edoxaban relative to warfarin for atrial fibrillation (AF). The results of the trials showed that all NOACs were at least non-inferior to warfarin in the prevention of stroke/thromboembolism and showed lower rates of intracranial bleeding than those associated with warfarin. However, the trials were designed differently, varied in the inclusion/exclusion criteria, and used either one dose or a low/high dose of the NOAC drug. Some of these differences have challenged the ability to directly compare various NOACs, and comparative data on effectiveness and intracranial bleeding are sparse in 'real-world' patients. Real-world data complement data from large randomized phase III trials by providing new aspects of the 'real-world' absolute risks of ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke associated with NOACs vs. warfarin. Moreover, 'real-world' fragile patients might have been included (e.g., patients with increased risk of bleeding, liver disease, and chronic kidney disease), although these patients would be less represented in trials. This paper introduces recently published real-world data of NOACs and further suggests the recommended dosage of NOACs for Korean patients.

Abstract: Prior real-world studies have shown that apixaban is associated with a reduced risk of stroke/systemic embolism (stroke/SE) and major bleeding versus warfarin. However, few studies evaluated the effectiveness and safety of apixaban according to its dosage, and most studies contained limited numbers of patients prescribed 2.5 mg twice-daily (BID) apixaban. Using pooled data from 4 American claims database sources, baseline characteristics and outcomes for patients prescribed 5 mg BID and 2.5 mg BID apixaban versus warfarin were compared. After 1:1 propensity-score matching, 31,827 5 mg BID apixaban-matched warfarin patients and 6600 2.5 mg BID apixaban-matched warfarin patients were identified. Patients prescribed 2.5 mg BID apixaban were older, had clinically more severe comorbidities, and were more likely to have a history of stroke and bleeding compared with 5 mg BID apixaban patients. Compared with warfarin, 5 mg BID apixaban was associated with a lower risk of stroke/SE (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.70, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.60-0.81) and major bleeding (HR: 0.59, 95% CI: 0.53-0.66). Compared with warfarin, 2.5 mg BID apixaban was also associated with a lower risk of stroke/SE (HR: 0.63, 95% CI: 0.49-0.81) and major bleeding (HR: 0.59, 95% CI: 0.49-0.71). In this real-world study, both apixaban doses were assessed in 2 patient groups differing in age and clinical characteristics. Each apixaban dose was associated with a lower risk of stroke/SE and major bleeding compared with warfarin in the distinct population for which it is being prescribed in United States clinical practice.

Abstract: Limited real-world data are available regarding the comparative safety of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs). The objective of this retrospective claims observational cohort study was to compare the risk of bleeding among non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) patients prescribed apixaban, dabigatran, or rivaroxaban. NVAF patients aged ≥18 years with a 1-year baseline period were included if they were new initiators of NOACs or switched from warfarin to a NOAC. Cox proportional hazards modelling was used to estimate the adjusted hazard ratios of any bleeding, clinically relevant non-major (CRNM) bleeding, and major inpatient bleeding within 6 months of treatment initiation for rivaroxaban and dabigatran compared to apixaban. Among 60,227 eligible patients, 8,785 were prescribed apixaban, 20,963 dabigatran, and 30,529 rivaroxaban. Compared to dabigatran or rivaroxaban patients, apixaban patients were more likely to have greater proportions of baseline comorbidities and higher CHA2DS2-VASc and HAS-BLED scores. After adjusting for baseline clinical and demographic characteristics, patients prescribed rivaroxaban were more likely to experience any bleeding (HR: 1.35, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.26-1.45), CRNM bleeding (HR: 1.38, 95% CI: 1.27-1.49), and major inpatient bleeding (HR: 1.43, 95% CI: 1.17-1.74), compared to patients prescribed apixaban. Dabigatran patients had similar bleeding risks as apixaban patients. In conclusion, NVAF patients treated with rivaroxaban appeared to have an increased risk of any bleeding, CRNM bleeding, and major inpatient bleeding, compared to apixaban patients. There was no significant difference in any bleeding, CRNM bleeding, or inpatient major bleeding risks between patients treated with dabigatran and apixaban.

Abstract: Background and Purpose- This ARISTOPHANES study (Anticoagulants for Reduction in Stroke: Observational Pooled Analysis on Health Outcomes and Experience of Patients) used multiple data sources to compare stroke/systemic embolism (SE) and major bleeding (MB) among a large number of nonvalvular atrial fibrillation patients on non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) or warfarin. Methods- A retrospective observational study of nonvalvular atrial fibrillation patients initiating apixaban, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, or warfarin from January 1, 2013, to September 30, 2015, was conducted pooling Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Medicare data and 4 US commercial claims databases. After 1:1 NOAC-warfarin and NOAC-NOAC propensity score matching in each database, the resulting patient records were pooled. Cox models were used to evaluate the risk of stroke/SE and MB across matched cohorts. Results- A total of 285 292 patients were included in the 6 matched cohorts: 57 929 apixaban-warfarin, 26 838 dabigatran-warfarin, 83 007 rivaroxaban-warfarin, 27 096 apixaban-dabigatran, 62 619 apixaban-rivaroxaban, and 27 538 dabigatran-rivaroxaban patient pairs. Apixaban (hazard ratio [HR], 0.61; 95% CI, 0.54-0.69), dabigatran (HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.68-0.94), and rivaroxaban (HR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.69-0.82) were associated with lower rates of stroke/SE compared with warfarin. Apixaban (HR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.54-0.62) and dabigatran (HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.66-0.81) had lower rates of MB, and rivaroxaban (HR, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.02-1.13) had a higher rate of MB compared with warfarin. Differences exist in rates of stroke/SE and MB across NOACs. Conclusions- In this largest observational study to date on NOACs and warfarin, the NOACs had lower rates of stroke/SE and variable comparative rates of MB versus warfarin. The findings from this study may help inform the discussion on benefit and risk in the shared decision-making process for stroke prevention between healthcare providers and nonvalvular atrial fibrillation patients.

Abstract: Atrial fibrillation (AF) prevalence increases with age; > 80% of US adults with AF are aged ≥ 65 years. Compare the risk of stroke/systemic embolism (SE), major bleeding (MB), net clinical outcome (NCO), and major adverse cardiac events (MACE) among elderly non-valvular AF (NVAF) Medicare patients prescribed direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) VS warfarin. NVAF patients aged ≥ 65 years who initiated DOACs (apixaban, dabigatran, and rivaroxaban) or warfarin were selected from 01JAN2013-31DEC2015 in CMS Medicare data. Propensity score matching was used to balance DOAC and warfarin cohorts. Cox proportional hazards models estimated the risk of stroke/SE, MB, NCO, and MACE. 37,525 apixaban-warfarin, 18,131 dabigatran-warfarin, and 55,359 rivaroxaban-warfarin pairs were included. Compared to warfarin, apixaban (HR: 0.69; 95% CI 0.59-0.81) and rivaroxaban (HR: 0.82; 95% CI 0.73-0.91) had lower risk of stroke/SE, and dabigatran (HR: 0.88; 95% CI 0.72-1.07) had similar risk of stroke/SE. Apixaban (MB: HR: 0.61; 95% CI 0.57-0.67; NCO: HR: 0.64; 95% CI 0.60-0.69) and dabigatran (MB: HR: 0.79; 95% CI 0.71-0.89; NCO: HR: 0.84; 95% CI 0.76-0.93) had lower risk of MB and NCO, and rivaroxaban had higher risk of MB (HR: 1.08; 95% CI 1.02-1.14) and similar risk of NCO (HR: 1.04; 95% CI 0.99-1.09). Compared to warfarin, apixaban had a lower risk for stroke/SE, MB, and NCO; dabigatran had a lower risk of MB and NCO; and rivaroxaban had a lower risk of stroke/SE but higher risk of MB. All DOACs had lower risk of MACE compared to warfarin.

By: Mitchell, Watson, Welsh, McGrogan
~
Abstract: Older people, are underrepresented in randomised controlled trials of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation (AF). The aim of this study was to combine data from observational studies to provide evidence for the treatment of people aged ≥75 years. Medline, Embase, Scopus and Web of Science were searched. The primary effectiveness outcome was ischaemic stroke. Safety outcomes were major bleeding, intracranial haemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding, myocardial infarction, and mortality. Twenty-two studies were eligible for inclusion. Two studies related specifically to people ≥75 years but were excluded from meta-analysis due to low quality; all data in the meta-analyses were from subgroups. The pooled risk estimate of ischaemic stroke was slightly lower for DOACs. There was no significant difference in major bleeding, mortality, or myocardial infarction. Risk of intracranial haemorrhage was 44% lower with DOACs, but risk of GI bleeding was 46% higher. Our results suggest that DOACs may be preferable for the majority of older patients with AF, provided they are not at significant risk of a GI bleed. However, these results are based entirely on data from subgroup analyses so should be interpreted cautiously. There is a need for adequately powered research in this patient group.

Abstract: Background and Purpose- We compared the 1-year safety and effectiveness of rivaroxaban 15 mg (R15) or rivaroxaban 20 mg (R20) to vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. Methods- New user cohort study of patients dispensed R15 or R20 versus VKA in 2013 or 2014 for nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, followed 1 year in the French Système National des Données de Santé (66 million people). R15 and R20 users were matched 1:1 with VKA users on sex, age, date of first drug dispensing, and high-dimensional propensity score. Hazard ratios (95% CIs) for stroke and systemic embolism, major bleeding, and death were computed using Cox proportional hazards or models by Fine and Gray during exposure. Results- In 31 171 matched R20 and VKA, mean age, 71; 62% men; 76% with CHA2DS2-VASc ≥2; 5% HAS-BLED >3 (hypertension, abnormal renal and liver function, stroke, bleeding, labile INR, elderly, drugs or alcohol); incidence rates for stroke and systemic embolism were 1.5% and 1.9% (hazard ratio, 0.79 [0.69-0.90]); major bleeding, 1.5% and 2.2% (0.67 [0.59-0.77]); death, 3.9% and 5.8% (0.67 [0.61-0.73]). In 23 314 matched R15 and VKA patients, mean age, 80; 47% men; 93% with CHA2DS2-VASc ≥2 and 9% with HAS-BLED >3; incidence rates of stroke and systemic embolism were 2.3% and 2.1% (1.05 [0.92-1.21]); major bleeding, 2.4% and 2.9% (0.84 [0.74-0.96]); death, 9.1% and 10.8% (0.85 [0.79-0.90]). Numbers needed to treat to observe one fewer death (NNT) were 46 for R15 and 61 for R20. Conclusions- In real life in France over 2013 to 2015, R15 and R20 were at least as effective and safer than VKA. Clinical Trial Registration- URL: http://www.encepp.eu.

Abstract: This study explored the efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban in elderly patients, at different doses and age of patients, and analyzed risk factors of bleeding. A retrospective analysis was conducted of 299 patients aged 60 years or older who were admitted to the First Hospital of Jilin University between January 2016 and August 2018. It was found that the rate of bleeding events (but not embolism) significantly increased as the dose of oral rivaroxaban increased (P < .001), and with age, especially in patients aged ≥80 years (P = .001, both). The multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that age (odds ratio [OR]: 2.963, 95% CI: 1.627-5.396) and the daily dose of rivaroxaban (OR: 2.325, 95% CI: 1.483-3.645) were independent risk factors for bleeding. The study determined that rivaroxaban anticoagulant therapy is effective in the elderly patients, but the risk of bleeding increases with age, and is a concern especially in the most old patients. The recommended daily dose of rivaroxaban is effective, but a lower dose is safer for the elderly patients.

By: Wang, Kehar, Iansavitchene, Lazo-Langner
~
Abstract: Introduction  In randomized trials in atrial fibrillation (AF) patients on direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have a lower risk of bleeding compared with warfarin. However, data from randomized trials may not extrapolate to general population. We aimed to determine the risk of bleeding in patients on DOACs in observational studies. Materials and Methods  Observational studies from 1990 to January 2019 were included. A pooled effect hazard ratio (HR) was calculated with a random effects model using the generic inverse variance method. Subgroup analyses according to previous anticoagulants exposure, study type, funding source, and DOAC type (direct thrombin inhibitors vs. factor Xa inhibitors) were conducted. Results  A total of 35 studies comprising 2,356,201 patients were included. The average pooled HR for observational data was 0.78 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.71, 0.85). There were no statistically significant differences in pooled HR by previous exposure to anticoagulants, DOAC type (direct thrombin vs. factor Xa inhibitors), study type, and funding source. Among patients receiving factor Xa inhibitors, patients on apixaban had a lower risk of bleeding compared with warfarin (HR 0.60, 95% CI 0.50, 0.71, p  < 0.001) in contrast to those on rivaroxaban (HR 0.98, 95% CI 0.91, 1.06, p  = 0.60). Conclusion  In observational studies, AF patients on DOACs experience less bleeding events compared with warfarin; however, apixaban and dabigatran, but not rivaroxaban, have a lower risk of bleeding than warfarin.

Title: Practice-derived data on non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant therapy to complement observations from randomized trials.

Abstract: Anticoagulation is fundamental in the management of patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). The study aims to provide a comparative review of the major phase III randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and real-world data (RWD) from reliable, high-grade Phase IV studies that assess the efficacy and safety of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) vs. vitamin K antagonists (VKAs). Observational studies based on nationwide or health insurance database records on the use of NOACs vs. VKAs in patients with AF were included. We performed a comparison of the efficacy and safety characteristics associated with NOACs vs. VKAs in RCTs and RWD. Although RCTs provide strong support for evidence-based practice, RWD may be used to reflect the broader picture of various clinical settings, provide supplementary insight and fulfil knowledge gaps. Both study types confirmed the safety and efficacy of NOACs in preventing stroke and thromboembolism in patients with AF. In comparison to VKAs, NOACs were associated with reduced risk of ischaemic events and lower rates of adverse events such as major bleeding or intracranial haemorrhage. Administration of NOACs might be associated with increased risk of dose-related gastrointestinal bleeding and myocardial ischaemic events, especially in the early treatment period after switching from VKAs. Special care should be taken in challenging clinical situations like severe renal or hepatic impairment when the treatment regimen needs to be considered individually. Randomized clinical trial and RWD studies are complementary and present comparable findings, affirming that NOACs are safe and effective for anticoagulation of patients with AF in daily clinical practice.

Title: Oral Anticoagulants for Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation in Patients With High Risk of Gastrointestinal Bleeding.
By: Lip, Keshishian, Zhang, Kang, Dhamane, Luo, Klem, Ferri, Jiang, Yuce, Deitelzweig
~
Abstract: Many patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) are at a high risk of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding due to conditions including older age; stage III to V chronic kidney disease (CKD); HAS-BLED (hypertension, kidney or liver disease, stroke history, prior bleeding, unstable international normalized ratio, age >65, drug or alcohol use) score of 3 or greater; corticosteroid, antiplatelet or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use; or GI conditions.

Title: Effectiveness and Safety of Dabigatran Compared to Vitamin K Antagonists in Non-Asian Patients with Atrial Fibrillation: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
By: Escobar, Barrios, Lip, Amin, Auladell-Rispau, Santero, Salazar, Requeijo
~
Abstract: Real-life data about the use of dabigatran in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation are warranted. The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to assess the effectiveness and safety of dabigatran, globally and stratified by dose (110/150 mg twice daily), vs vitamin K antagonists in non-Asian patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation from 'real-world' studies.

Title: Reappraisal of Non-vitamin K Antagonist Oral Anticoagulants in Atrial Fibrillation Patients: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
By: Liu, Yang, Cheng, Ma, Zhu

Abstract: Background: Recent observational studies have compared effectiveness and safety profiles between non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) and warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). Nevertheless, the confounders may exist due to the nature of clinical practice-based data, thus potentially influencing the reliability of results. This systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to compare the effect of NOACs with warfarin based on the propensity score-based observational studies vs. randomized clinical trials (RCTs). Methods: Articles included were systematically searched from the PubMed and EMBASE databases until March 2021 to obtain relevant studies. The primary outcomes were stroke or systemic embolism (SSE) and major bleeding. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of the outcomes were extracted and then pooled by the random-effects model. Results: A total of 20 propensity score-based observational studies and 4 RCTs were included. Compared with warfarin, dabigatran (HR, 0.82 [95% CI, 0.71-0.96]), rivaroxaban (HR, 0.80 [95% CI, 0.75-0.85]), apixaban (HR, 0.75 [95% CI, 0.65-0.86]), and edoxaban (HR, 0.71 [95% CI, 0.60-0.83]) were associated with a reduced risk of stroke or systemic embolism, whereas dabigatran (HR, 0.76 [95% CI, 0.65-0.87]), apixaban (HR, 0.61 [95% CI, 0.56-0.67]), and edoxaban (HR, 0.58 [95% CI, 0.45-0.74]) but not rivaroxaban (HR, 0.92 [95% CI, 0.84-1.00]) were significantly associated with a decreased risk of major bleeding based on the observational studies. Furthermore, the risk of major bleeding with dabigatran 150 mg was significantly lower in observational studies than that in the RE-LY trial, whereas the pooled results of observational studies were similar to the data from the corresponding RCTs in other comparisons. Conclusion: Data from propensity score-based observational studies and NOAC trials consistently suggest that the use of four individual NOACs is non-inferior to warfarin for stroke prevention in AF patients.
